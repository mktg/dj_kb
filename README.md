# TL;DR version

My biggest **Laptop** reasons are not having to manage USB sticks, and it has much more features than standalone.\
My biggest **DDJ-1000** reason is big jogwheels.\
My biggest **Traktor** reason is using my OS folders as "playlists", its effects and its advanced mapping possibilities.

# MindMap Summary

This page has my knowledge sharing about Traktor, Mappings, Hardware, DJing, DJ Set, etc.\
The picture below summarizes the main ideas and dependencies explained in these blog posts.

# OS-Folders

## How large is your collection? How broad is your collection?

I have a large collection with thousands of files. It is also quite broad, featuring hundreds of playlists, and dozens of genres / sub-genres / decades combinations.

My numbers are:
* **Tracks**: 8000
* **Playlists**: 300
* **Sub-genres:** 50 
* **Major-genres:** 10
* **Decades:** 5
* **DJs**: 2

To manage this complexity I've build my own set of personal tags that I fully trust.
As such, the first action on new files is to tag them into my structure. This ignores any previous tags made by someone else.

Below an example how my structure looks like; the full tree is far larger.
![DJ Genres](pics/folder_organization_dj_genres.png?raw=true)

See also [Why I manage music using OS-folders only](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only).
  

## Why I manage music using OS-folders only

Above, I've explained [the size and complexity of my collection](#How-large-is-your-collection-How-broad-is-your-collection).\
This is nothing new; I know many DJs with [the same "problem"](https://code.google.com/archive/p/serato-itch-sync/). The difference is on the *how*; In my case I manage the collection only in OS-folders, instead of DJ-playlists.

Main reasons are:
* **#1: Multiple Windows:** File explorer opens instantaneously with Win+E, and allows any number of windows, monitors and [tabs](http://qttabbar.wikidot.com/). 
* **#2: Tree Tagging:** More crucially, all windows have the whole tree visible. This is essential to quickly tag my files by just moving them to the correct correct folder. Similarly, the structure grows just by creating new sub-folders as needed.
* **#3: Simpler Folders**: OS-Folders contain either files, sub-folders, or both. [This 2-step organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#History) is simpler is than the iTunes 3-step model of "folders -> playlists -> files" (later copied by almost all DJ softwares).
* **#4: Local Searches:** By far my most common task is to check if I already have a particular track, and where is it tagged. File explorer allows local searches on a folder and its sub-folders only. This enables me to quickly find things by just typing a few letters of the filename. AFAIK only Serato has this feature (called ["include subcrates"](https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/227626268-Subcrates))
* **#5: Tags Cleanup:** Before tagging the file, I rename the filenames to correct its artist / title. [MP3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/) helps a lot to clean up the formatting, using [my own scripts](tools_traktor/Mp3tagSettings.zip) to automatically capitalize the names as “ARTIST1 ft. ARTIST2 - Capitalized Title - Remix”, and to update the internal mp3 tags. 
* **#6: Software Independence:** Using OS-folders you are independent of any possible DJ software and itunes. It also trivial to [sync between laptops](#how-i-synchronize-and-backup-my-whole-traktor-music-and-configuration-across-laptops-and-a-nas) and make perfect backups [to my NAS](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS718+). It is also trivial to load a whole genres to USB sticks to listen in cars.

## How to manage your collection using operating systems folders and without DJ playlists (ie, using only Finder, Windows Explorer, etc) 

Above I've described [Why I manage music using OS-folders only](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only). In this post I will describe *how* I manged to **fully automate** my workflow between DJ softwares.

* **#0: File operations:** [As explained above](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only) I continuously search files, change the filenames and move the files around left and right.
* **#1: Traktor Repair:** When I first open Traktor, it automatically [repairs its own database](#why-is-traktor-my-software-of-choice-a-database-repair-mass-relocate). For this I just run a mass-relocate on my whole music root folder, which refinds all moved and renames files in a single go.
* **#2: Update collection:** The second step is just to import the whole music root folder into Traktor. As this skips previous files, in practice it only imports the New files. The last step is to delete the remaining missing files (that are really deleted - otherwise they would been found on step #1) 
* **#3: Duplicate Cues**: For the rare cases that a file is in multiple sub-genres, I just copy them physically in different folders. I have 10% of duplicated files. Then I run a [python script](tools_traktor/traktor_clone_cues.py) to automatically duplicate the CUEs for these files. This tool is similar to [the traktor Librarian](http://www.flowrl.com/librarian).
* **#4: Dj Converter:** I use the [DJ Data Converter](#which-dj-converters-avoid-the-26ms-shift-issue) to generate the rekordbox.xml file without the [26ms shift problem](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares).
* **#5: Rekordbox Import:** On rekordox first I delete all missing files, then import the whole collection "as-is", and then update the collection with the XML file that came from the (repaired) Traktor collection. These steps are fully automatic and it ensures the Rekordbox collection matches the Traktor collection.
* **#6: Rekordbox Search:** I only use rekordbox for video gigs. There I use the explorer node to see my files, and search for files in the whole collection. For the rare case I need to search inside a "playlist", I use a real File Explorer window in parallel when needed (because rekordbox [still lacks a search box in OS-folders](#why-is-traktor-my-software-of-choice-b-os-search-no-playlists))
* **#7: CDJ export:** I only really need playlists for CDJs. There are scripts to mass-convert all folders to DJ playlists. Then I do the usual rekordbox step to prepare USBs pens.
  * Windows version is http://samsoft.org.uk/iTunes/ImportFolderStructure.vbs; 
  * Mac version is https://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=droptoaddnmake; 
  * A Serato-specific version is in https://code.google.com/archive/p/serato-itch-sync/

## Do you use mp3 file metadata?

I do not use metadata, not even the "genre" field. This is because my collection is [too broad](#How-large-is-your-collection-How-broad-is-your-collection) for me to depend on it.

Instead, I generate the fields automatically from the filename + folder. That is my granularity - which is also independent of any DJ software. In this process I ensure that all filenames are normalized to a clean format (ARTIST - TITLE - REMIX), and store them in [hierarchical folders](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only)

Then I run two automated tools:
* [mp3tag scripts](tools_traktor/Mp3tagSettings.zip) that clean-up the filename and generate metadata
* [python script](tools_traktor/traktor_clone_cues.py) that duplicate the cues of the duplicated files 

## How do you achieve independence from DJ software

Independence from DJ software is something that I value. This is in stark contrast with, say, the RB6 encrypted database.

I achieve this as follows:
* DJ Playlists: my OS folders are my playlists. This is trivial to backup and its the most durable method I ever seen.
* CUEs/LOOPs: I have my cues stored in traktor, which writes this info to the files themselves. This is very durable and really convinient. 
The database is also very open and very simple to process - its an XML text file.
* Star rating: I do not use this feature

See the above blog posts for more details on these organization methods.

# Traktor software


## Why is Traktor my software of choice

Traktor has unique features - big and small - that I depend on.\
Other softwares have nice unique features too, but I built my workflows on these specific ones.

## Why is Traktor my software of choice: a) Automatic finds Moved / Renamed files (mass relocate)

Traktor is above to find RENAMED files fully automatically without losing CUE points, beat grid or re-analysis.

I RENAME and MOVE files very regularly at the OS-folders level, using Windows Explorer/macOS finder.

When Traktor starts, it does a "consistency check" to confirm if all files are still there. (demo: [0:24 of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_zYavcCa7k&t=24s)). This finds all missing files in a single go (demo: [0:50 of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_zYavcCa7k&t=50))\
Then, the mass-relocate process fixes everything in a single go as well; you just select the root folder that contains your files "somewhere". In the extreme worst case this would be your whole hard drive. (demo: [5:36 of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_zYavcCa7k&t=320s)).

The relocate process is reasonably straightforward for MOVED files. However it is much much harder for RENAMED files.\
Traktor is the only software that achives that because it fingerprints everything in a private field called "[AudioId](https://www.mail-archive.com/mixxx-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg05061.html)")

When the mass-relocate process ends, everything is magically found again. Crucially all metadata is kept: CUE points, beat grid, analysed BPM, stripe, etc.\
Together with the OS-search feature described below, this enables me to use folders as "virtual playlists".
* **Comparison to Rekordbox v6:** V6 fixed this problem, well done! However it is not a solution because of the [missing XML export issue](#issues-of-the-V6-Rekordbox-migration---major)
* **Comparison to Rekordbox v5:** Renamed files need to be relocated FILE by FILE.\
Moved files can be done FOLDER by FOLDER.\
If this manual process is skipped, the files are seen as brand new, losing all meta-data.\
[An external tool](https://github.com/edkennard/rekordbox-repair) helps the moved files case. [Example of Pioneer forum request](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115018095303-Reasons-to-think-i-leave-from-rekordbox-?page=1#community_comment_360000392646)
* **Comparison to VDJ:** Everything need to be relocated FILE by FILE.
* **Comparison to Serato:** To test.


## Why is Traktor my software of choice: b) OS-search to use (no playlists)

Traktor allows searching inside any OS folders. I don't have DJ playlists inside Traktor; instead, my OS-folders are my "virtual playlists".\
I have a very large collection with dozens of genres, sub-genres and decades. For that I've created a structure where each decade is a separate folder, inside a parent genre/sub-genre folders.\
When I'm playing a specific genre I can search only that decade (=OS folder). If I want something else I can always search the whole collection at any time.\
([See this blog post for more detail on these methods](#how-to-manage-your-collection-using-operating-systems-folders-and-without-dj-playlists-ie-using-only-finder-windows-explorer-etc))
* **Comparison to Rekordbox:** Rekordbox displays OS folders, but you can't search inside them. [Example of Pioneer forum request](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115018095303-Reasons-to-think-i-leave-from-rekordbox-?page=1#community_comment_360000392646)
* **Comparison to Serato:** Serato has a nicer way to display OS folders, but you can't search inside them
* **Comparison to VDJ:** VDJ has really good OS-searches, better than traktor, by having a "recurse" option to see all sub-folder files in a flat view



## Why is Traktor my software of choice: c) Advanced MIDI mapping
  
Traktor supports complex MIDI mapping with 8x variables, 2x conditionals and any number of actions per MIDI input

My [DDJ-1000 mapping has FX chains of the Jogwheel](https://github.com/pestrela/music_scripts/blob/master/traktor/ddj_1000_traktor_mapping/DDJ-1000%20v6.5.1%20TP3%20-%20Quick%20overview.pdf). For a demo, see at 6:30 of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tQZEHr8hk&t=392s \
My [AKAI AMX mapping has 10 layers built using shifts and states](https://github.com/pestrela/music_scripts/blob/master/traktor/akai_amx_traktor_mapping/AMX%20v1.0.1%20TP3_TP2%20-%20Quick%20overview.pdf) to cram A LOT more functionality than the existing buttons.\
This is only possible if midi mapping has variables and multiple actions per physical input.
\
* **Comparison to Rekordbox:** No variables at all, no multiple actions. They only allow you to assign a single command to a single button. 
* **Comparison to Serato:** No variables at all, no multiple actions. They only allow you to assign a single command to a single button. 
* **Comparison to VDJ:** VDJ is even better than traktor, has it has a full scripting language built-in ([VDJscript](https://www.virtualdj.com/wiki/VDJscript.html)). 
It features infinite variables, conditions and states; Traktor only has 8 variables, 2 conditions and 8 states.\
  VDJ also features extremely nice [mapping editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SU2OyDB9PQ&t=200),
  [pad editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT1nZVpUUr8&t=50),
  and [custom button editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGbw2RHV_j0&t=180), all with dropdowns and chained together.

See also ["Why I moved to BOME midi mapping"](#BOME-mappings-migration).


## Why is Traktor my software of choice: d) Hotcues move the temporary cue as well

**Update:** I've now made a video to show this  request: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tINljMwc4Co

I use the hotcues as internal "bookmarks". In Traktor, pressing a hotcue moves the temporary cue as well.\
This is very useful for  previewing an old song that you dont remember anymore. When you are done, you just move it to the last point using the big round button.
* **Comparison to Rekordbox:** No option to move the temporary cue when pressing a hotcue. This causes massive confusion to me every single time. This would be trivial to fix using advanced MIDI mapping. [This was requested in their forum](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021313752-Is-there-any-way-at-all-to-reassign-the-cue-button-to-cue-to-the-most-recently-selected-hot-cue-rather-than-only-being-used-to-make-cue-points-)
* **Comparison to Serato:** untested
* **Comparison to VDJ:** untested, but not a problem for sure (trivial to change using advanced MIDI mapping)

## Why is Traktor my software of choice: e) Stronger Sync than others

Traktor features a very strong master clock that was built for the remix decks. As such its sync is in general stronger than the other softwares I tested. 
Using Beatsync the phrasing is always kept for any action I might do to the track: Beatjump, Hot cues, Temporary Cue, Pitch bend, Tempo change, Scratch, etc.

* **Comparison to Serato:** see [this comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyAj4IyFNCs). Even there I still found myself having the "gold" sync instead of the desired "blue" sync
* **Comparison to Rekordbox:** It has the best sync outside Traktor 
* **Comparison to VDJ:** untested

## Which features I miss in Traktor

Specific features:
* **#1: Elastic beatgrids**: This is crucial as I play very old music and many music styles. [tool](#how-to-emulate-elastic-beatgrids-in-traktor)
* **#2: Include subcrates** just like [serato](https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/227626268-Subcrates)
* **#3: Pioneer DDJ**: Plug-and-Play to Pioneer gear / DDJ controllers, because this is the [most popular equipment today](../census_graphs)
* **#4: Pad modes**: I have multiple pad modes in my mappings, but would love to see them on screen, and have an associated pad editor just like Rekordbox and VirtualDJ
* **#5: Turntable FX**: Turntable start&stop on the [play/pause button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPnmyDiaJTE)
* **#6: Video support**
* **#7: [VDJscript](https://www.virtualdj.com/wiki/VDJscript.html)**, with a lot more than 8x variables and 2x conditions
* **#8: Smart playlists** and related tracks

In general I fully agree with [this Digital DJ Tips article](https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2019/10/what-next-for-traktor/). Generic comments:
* **#1:** “Please embrace hardware partners again…”
* **#2:** “Please speed up software development!”
* **#3:** “Please, no more reinventing the wheel :)”

But in the end Traktor has [has unique features that I depend on](#why-is-traktor-my-software-of-choice).

See also the [most popular DJ softwares census](../census_graphs).

## Include subcrates like serato

Serato has an option to enables very easy **local searches** on a folder and its sub-folders only. 

From the [serato manual](https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001013076-Intro-Setup):  
"Crates Include Subcrates: When enabled, Crates in your Library will also show the contents of any included Subcrates. "

Something similar could be done with smartlists, but this feature works automatically for any folder and for any tree structure.

For example, given this structure:

```
Music collection
  Dance
  Rock
  HipHop
    Old school
      file1
      file2
    New hiphop
      file3
      file4
```

in Traktor, clicking on "hiphop" will show nothing. This is because the files are inside the specific playlists.
in Serato, same story if "include subcrates" is OFF; however, if "include subcrates" is ON, then clicking hiphop will show 4 files, taken from both oldschool and new school.

This concept is similar how the whole collection contains all files from all playlists, but generalized to specific localized folders with ONLY its sub-folders contents. So no mixing of hip-hop with dance, and all of this automatic for any tree structure.


## How to create your own karaoke files automatically using Stems and AI

**Update:** this is now [realtime in DJay](https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2020/06/djay-pro-ai-talkthrough-review/) and [VirtualDJ](https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2020/06/virtual-dj-2021-real-time-stems/). 
Well done!!!  

[Stems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grgjIhs-OC8) is a new file format that contains 4 sub-tracks you can mix on your own. 
This is read and manipulted nativelly by Traktor.
 
[Spleeter](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20949338/vocal-isolation-ai-machine-learning-deezer-spleeter-automated-open-source-tensorflow)
 is a open-source AI tool that quickly isolates the vocals in any song, producing four seprate audio files. 
 ([Another link](https://deezer.io/releasing-spleeter-deezer-r-d-source-separation-engine-2b88985e797e)).
 
[Stemgen](https://github.com/axeldelafosse/stemgen) is a script that groups several programs to generate a stem file automaticalyy

[NUO stems](https://github.com/dj-nuo/nuo-stems) is the same idea, but fully packaged, supported, and with helper functions to [clone the existing cues](tools_traktor/traktor_clone_cues.py) to the new files.

Want to just have a quick go with stems? [This pack](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/specials/stems-for-all/free-stems-tracks/) has example tracks.  
Of which I recommend these files:
* LM_StockholmSyndrome.stem.mp4
* NR_FeverLine.stem.mp4
* PR_OhNo.stem.mp4

## Description of the basic effects 

These are definitions from the basic effects. This will be useful later to describe the FX chains (combos).

* Basic FX:
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal_processing#Audio_effects
  * Delay = repeat sound once after X beats (can be fractional)
  * Echo = repeat sound multiple times, with decreasing intensity
  * Reverb = repeat sound multiple times heavily very soon
  * Flanger = a single delay with very short duration (short phase)
  * Filter = lower/cut or raise specific frequencies
  * Overdrive = clipping to increase loudness
  * Pitch = changing tone with same tempo
  * Resonators = emphasize harmonic frequency content on specified frequencies.
  * Modulation = change frequency in relation to a signal
  * Compression = reduction of dynamic range
  * Gate = ON/OFF synced to BPM
  
## How to create unique effects by chaining base effects 

You can easily create unique effects by chaining existing effects in very specific ways.

This is called the "Fader FX theory" as invented by Ean Golden in 2008
* **Article:** https://djtechtools.com/2008/12/15/fader-fx-theory/
* **Demo video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjjA0xPkXMs
  
This uses 3x effects in a chain:
* **Slot 1:** Repeating effect 
  * eg: Beatmasher, Gater, Delays
* **Slot 2:** Shaping effect 
  * eg: Filter, Lo-fi, Peak filter
* **Slot 3:** Dimensional effect 
  * eg: Reverb, delay
  
Below, blog posts on a) lists of FX chains and b) descriptions of MixerFX / MacroFX / SoundColorFX.

## Which basic effects constitute Traktor mixerFX and macroFX?
  
MixerFX / MacroFX are essentially FX chains with specific defaults and behavior.\
This post describes the basic elements of MixerFX using simpler base effects (delay, echo, filter, reverb, flanger, beatmasher, bitcrush, white noise).


* TP3.0 MIXERFX:
  * https://djtechtools.com/2018/10/18/traktor-pro-3-out-now-heres-whats-new/
  * Reverb: resonant reverb + heavy filter
  * Dual Delay: 1/2 delay + filter
  * Dotted Delay: heavy delay (staccato)
  * Noise: white noise + filter
  * Time Gater: ON/OFF BPM-sync + filter
  * Flanger: 4-beat flanger + filter
  * Barber Pole: soft Shepard Tone
  * Crush: bit crush (no pitch increase) + filter
  * Filter: Filter + Light resonance

* TP2.6 MACROFX:
  * https://techtools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202165534-NEW-MACRO-FX
  * https://crossfadr.com/2012/11/21/overhauling-the-traktor-native-instruments-new-traktor-pro-2-6-release/
  * Wormhole = heavy filter + heavy flanger + delay (Buildup//breakdown)
  * PolarWind = heavy flanger (coloring) + light filter + reverb (Mixing/punch in)
  * FlightTest = heavy echo + resonant filter (Punch In)
  * LaserSlicer = heavy beatmasher + flanger (Punch in/buildup/breakdown)
  * DarkMatter = heavy crush + delay + compression (for Mixing)
  * Zzzurp = related to Ringmodulator (masher + flanger + crush + reverb) (Punch in/breakdown)
  * EventHorizon = heavy filter + echo (Breakdown/punch in)
  * Bass-o-Matic = heavy triplets slicer (Punch in/breakdown)
  * Strrretch (Slow) = loop sampler (Buildup/breakdown)
  * Strrretch (Fast) = loop sampler (Buildup/breakdown)
  * GranuPhase = delay to 2nd and 4th beat (Punch in/buildup/breakdown)

* Normal effects:
  * https://www.digitaldjtips.com/reviews/native-instruments-traktor-kontrol-z2/
  * Transpose Stretch = Dubstep-style
  * Ringmodulator = Josh Wink “tweak”
  * Tape Delay = “chillwave”

To test these effects, loop a simple beat and characterize what you hear based on basic FX concepts.
To test delay/echo/reverb presence, stop the track to hear the FX tail.

## Describing the basic effects that constitute VirtualDJ SoundColorFX
  
  
VirtualDJ has similar FX chains, with specific defaults and behavior.

## Which tracks have multiple BPMs

Two types of tracks have multiple BPMs:
* **Unsteady BPMs:** 
  * Definition: these tracks floats around a single BPM (+-1% range). Examples:
  * Live drummers: [Guns N' Roses - Sweet Child O' Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w7OgIMMRc4)
  * Old disco / 80s Pop tracks: [Matia Bazar - Ti Sento](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk7bR54G2BA)
* **Transition Tracks:**
  * Definition: these tracks have clear BPM changes (+-10% range). Examples:
  * Abrupt 85->115 bpm: [Magic Drum Orchestra - Drop it like its Hot](https://youtu.be/W-nrHptw4Ow) 
  * Smooth 126->98 bpm: [Planet Soul - Set me Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5HEfbxk7Mw)

[list2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ybt30/transition_tracks/)


## What are Elastic Beatgrids

"Elastic beatgrids" is a feature that explicitly allows **multiple BPMs** in each track.

Without elastic beatgrids, the following becomes impossible to perform without the audience noticing:
* **Beatjumps:** 
  * Impossible to fix in advance because the jump happens instantaneously
* **FX BPM-synced effects:** (eg delay)
  * Impossible to fix in any situation, because FX fully depend on the beatgrid
* **AutoLoops:**
  * IN point: with quantize off, you have to enable the loop at precisely the right time
  * OUT point: In this case you have to immediately enter "loop out adjust mode" to fix the out point as fast as you can    
* **Sync beatmatch:**
  * In this case you HAVE to compensate continuously using the jogwheels on the whole eg. 60s transition (manual beatmatch)


## Which softwares support Elastic Beatgrids

Traktor misses elastic beatgrids. This was the #1 request from the [Digital DJ Tips interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFcnImYgsII&feature=youtu.be&t=199) as well.

| Software | Elastic Beatgrids | Multiple Beatmarkers | Video |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RekordBox** | yes | yes (see note1) | https://youtu.be/aTHFpwSMsZI?t=499 |
| **Serato** | yes | yes | https://youtu.be/wLt5fhZJGps&t=420 |
| **VirtualDJ** | yes | yes | https://youtu.be/PrKBerB2n3I?t=49 |
| **Traktor** | no | yes | [main discussion thread](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/how-to-fix-tracks-with-unsteady-bpms-using-just-traktor-pro.114480/) |
| **Denon Prime** | no | no (see note2) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqhDRX6ghfM&t=598 |


**Note1:** Manually beatgriding tracks in rekordbox is tricky because its a strictly left-to-right operation.\
In other words: there is no way to put beatmarkers in front of the track without deleting them at the middle/end as well. 
[more info](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115010528306)\
**Note2:** Denon Prime [wraps tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqhDRX6ghfM&t=598) and has problems with ID3tag [whole BPM numbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/DenonPrime/comments/cfxqr2/prime_4s_trusted_bpm_aka_why_using_the_bpm_tag_is/). 



## How to emulate Elastic Beatgrids in Traktor


Below a recipe to **approximate** Elastic beatgrids in Traktor, automatically using Rekordbox conversion.\
The simplest method is presented first, then a more accurate/faster method is presented second.

**Important:** this is only applicable for unsteady tracks 
([more info](#Which-tracks-benefit-from-emulated-Elastic-beatgrids)). 

**Simple method:** 
1. Download the free V5 rekordbox: [link](https://rekordbox.com/en/download5/)
1. Select the tracks with single, but unsteady, BPMs: [guide](https://rekord.cloud/blog/should-you-analyze-your-tracks-with-dynamic-bpm-in-rekordbox) 
1. Analyse these tracks in dynamic mode: [guide](https://rekord.cloud/blog/should-you-analyze-your-tracks-with-dynamic-bpm-in-rekordbox)
1. Export your collection.xml: [guide](https://rekord.cloud/wiki/library-import)
1. Convert your this file from Rekordbox format to Traktor format: [guide](#which-dj-converters-avoid-the-26ms-shift-issue)
1. Import your files into Traktor: [guide](https://rekord.cloud/wiki/library-export) 

![traktor_elastic_beatgrids2](pics/traktor_elastic_beatgrids2.jpg?raw=true)

 
## How to emulate Elastic Beatgrids in Traktor - More complex workflow

This is a revised version of the [basic workflow(#How-to-emulate-Elastic-Beatgrids-in-Traktor). 

Benefits are more accuracy of the end result because it adds additional beatmarkers every 4 beats, 
it avoids the [26ms mp3 shift issue](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares)
and its a lot faster by limiting the tracks and by directly patching the cues in the collection (instead of regular importing the files).



**Concrete differences:**
1. Download specifically v5.6.0 rekordbox. 
  * This was the last without an XML import bug: [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV89dj1hDWM)
1. Manually remove the non-dynamic tracks from the XML.
  * There is no way to export specific playlists/tracks, you always get the whole collection
  * so by manually removing the tracks the later stages will be a lot faster  
1. Use [rekordbox_add_beatmarkers.py](tools_traktor/rekordbox_add_beatmarkers.py) 
  * This will force a beatmarker every 4 beats. 
  * These beatmarkers are very accurate because it still uses the dynamic BPM **before** conversion. 
1. Use a converter that specifically addresses the 26-ms shift issue: [guide](#which-dj-converters-avoid-the-26ms-shift-issue)
1. Patch your files into Traktor using [Traktor_clone_cues.py](#what-software-tools-did-you-built-for-Traktor)

![traktor_elastic_beatgrids3](pics/traktor_elastic_beatgrids3.jpg?raw=true)
 
[Traktor forum post](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/how-to-emulate-elastic-beatgrids-in-traktor-via-rekordbox-conversion.375229/)

## Which tracks benefit from emulated Elastic beatgrids?

**Unsteady tracks: YES**
* **Examples:** 80s Pop, 70s DiscoSound, Live drummers (any decade)
* **Typical range:** +- 1% bpm error
* **Error:** Very small; the error is reset every 4th beat will always reset it

**Transition tracks: NO**
* **Examples:**
  * [Magic Drum Orchestra - Drop it like its Hot](https://youtu.be/W-nrHptw4Ow) 85->115 bpm, Abrupt change
  * [Planet Soul - Set me Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5HEfbxk7Mw) 126->98 bpm, Smooth change
* **Typical range:** +- 15% bpm  (change from 3/4 to 4/4 signature)
* **Error:** Too much; the 3rd beat will have an half beat error (see picture)
  * Note: setting beatmarkers every 1 beat breaks Traktor sync dynamics

# Traktor Slow preferences Window
  
This section is all about the slow preferences window.\
I've been able to reduce this from 18 seconds to only 3 seconds.
 
* [Issue explanation](#Why-MIDI-mappings-makes-the-preferences-window-slow)
* [Measurements](#How-slow-does-the-preferences-window-get)
* [Naive solution](#Could-we-just-move-all-entries-to-a-single-page)
* [Swapping configurations](#How-to-swap-Traktor-configurations-without-the-slow-preferences-window)

  
## Why MIDI mappings makes the preferences window slow

Traktor has thousands of useless ["MidiDefinition structures"](https://github.com/ivanz/TraktorMappingFileFormat/blob/df5f544d10e3293b72b829841e654da0db71c4b0/Tools/TSI%20Mapping%20Template.bt#L130) 
for every possible midi combination that **COULD** be used.\
This set is much much larger than the entries that are **actually used**.

Worse, these entries are replicated in every single "empty page".

In practice this makes [the preferences window very slow](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/preferences-window-freeze.328315/). 
For example [Pioneer DDJ-SZ mapping take 18 seconds to load](#How-slow-does-the-preferences-window-get).
A second sign is that it makes the TSI file much larger.

The [CMDR editor](https://github.com/cmdr-editor/cmdr#2020-improvements) removes this overhead 
(see [line 337 of this file](https://github.com/cmdr-editor/cmdr/blob/master/cmdr/cmdr.TsiLib/Device.cs#L337)).\
However Traktor still recreates these entries **per page** anyway.


## How slow does the preferences window get?

Having many midi pages makes the [preferences window slow](#Why-MIDI-mappings-makes-the-preferences-window-slow).

The biggest offender is the Pioneer mappings for the SX2 and SZ controllers. 
They have 14 pages, so it takes >18 seconds for it to load in my laptop.

My mappings are have more functions, but only take ~5 seconds to load because I only use 5 pages.

On my next version I managed to go to 3 pages, for a ~3 second delay.


|            | Version     | Pages | Delay (s) | | Entries (K) | Size (Mb) | Optimized (Mb) |
|------------|-------------|-------|-----------|-|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Pionner    | v1.0.0      | 14    | 18.4      | | 9.3     | 10.9      | 2.7                 |
| DJ Estrela | v6.7.0      | 5     | 5.2       | | 9.7     | 5.7       | 2.8                 |
| DJ Estrela | v7.1.0      | 2     | 2.5       | | 10.0    | 4.4       | 2.7                 |

[Table Source](pics/traktor_slow_preferences_-_measurements.xlsx)


## Could we just move all entries to a single page?

No. Any complex behavior needs state variables, and each page only has 8 variables per page.

When you run out of variables the simplest action is to add a new page. 

My mappings are [much faster than the Pioneer ones](#How-slow-does-the-preferences-window-get) 
because I specifically shared variables, and I [moved functionality to BOME](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Traktor-limits).

## How to swap Traktor configurations without the slow preferences window

[This script](tools_traktor/traktor_swap_configuration.sh) lets you swap between two traktor configurations easily. 

This is useful when you sometimes use a controller as your audio device, but other times use your internal sound card. 
This saves you to having to open the preferences window to change the audio device, 
which is [very slow when you have large mappings](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/preferences-window-freeze.328315/page-2#post-1870879).

**Script installation:**
* save [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pestrela/music_scripts/master/traktor/tools_traktor/traktor_swap_configuration.sh) in your desktop with "right-click"/"save-as"
* make the script executable with 'chmod +x traktor_swap_configuration.sh '
* redefine the 'traktor_root_folder' variable to your documents traktor root
* *run it once* to copy the first config

**First time setup:**
* Open Traktor
* change the config to DDJ-1000
* close traktor
* *run script*
* open traktor
* change config to internal soundcard
* close traktor

**To Activate configuration #1:**
* *run the script*
* open traktor
* confirm the audio card is ddj-1000
* Close taktor

**To Activate configuration #2:**
* *run the script*
* open traktor
* confirm the audio card is Internal Soundcard
* Close taktor

  
# BOME mappings migration

Traktor has advanced MIDI mapping ([link](https://bit.ly/2NrlVzy)), which is important to extend its longevitity.

However every year Controllers get more complex, so doing mappings today ranges between hard to impossible ([link](https://bit.ly/2NrlVzy)).

Some other anedotic evidence on this are the [preferences freeze](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/preferences-window-freeze.328315/page-2#post-1870879), the turntable play/pause looper, the DDJ-1000SRT missing jog screens, 
and the HC-4500 mapping to get track details.

**Specific Blog posts:**
* [a) Impossible mapping features](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Impossible-features)
* [b) Possible, but with major limits](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Traktor-limits)
* [c) BOME limits](#Some-Limitations-of-BOME-mappings)
* [d) Future of Traktor mappings](#How-I-see-the-future-of-Traktor-mappings)

Because of this all my latest mappings require [BOME](https://www.bome.com/products/miditranslator).\
(The older versions do not require BOME and are simpler to install).


![bome_versions](pics/bome_versions.jpg?raw=true)

  
## Why I moved to BOME midi mapping: Impossible features

* **#1: 14-bit out messages**: Trakor supports *receiving* high resolution midi messages. I need to *send* them as well [on my DDJ-1000 mapping](../ddj/1%20MIDI%20codes/DDJ-1000RB%20-%20MIDI%20Messages.pdf)
* **#2: Sequence of Events**: For PadFX, I *first* need to change the FX, and *then* need to turn it on. This is not something Traktor support; both actions are tried simultaneously resulting in something else. More info: page 88 of the [Rudi Elephant mapping](pics/RUDI-Js%20ELEPHANT%20TSI%20for%20VCI-400SE%20%2B%20Maschine%20(MK1)%20%2B%20BCR%202000%20v2.0.pdf).
* **#3: Timers**: Something simple as end-of-track blinking require timers to schedule actions for later. Same story for [vinyl break on the play/pause button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPnmyDiaJTE), as implemented by [Traktor Mapping Service](http://traktormappingservice.com/)
* **#4: Any event as a Conditional**: Some events can be inputs to conditionals, like "is in active loop". However many events are missing, for example "which deck is master." To implement this, please see page 87 of the [Rudi Elephant mapping](pics/RUDI-Js%20ELEPHANT%20TSI%20for%20VCI-400SE%20%2B%20Maschine%20(MK1)%20%2B%20BCR%202000%20v2.0.pdf).

Some of these features are possible in QML
, which i used on the S4Mk3/S8/XDJ-1000mk2, but [is not MIDI](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/qml-to-midi-out.378533/).


## Why I moved to BOME midi mapping: Traktor Limits

Also, I've also hit the limits of Traktor mappings multiple times. Below are the features that are possible in Traktor but only by significantly increasing the mapping complexity.

* **a) more modifiers**: I use a lot more than [8 modifiers](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/controllerism-more-modifiers-more-bits-more-conditions.329045/). I use a lot more than 3 bits per modifier state. To go around this I add a lot of complexity to my mappings. This in turn [freezes your preferences](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/preferences-window-freeze.328315/page-2#post-1870879) window - please see below.
* **b) preferences window freeze:** To add more variables, you need to add extra mapping pages. Having more than 6 pages [freeze your preferences window](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/preferences-window-freeze.328315/page-2#post-1870879) **even if they are completely empty**.
* **c) more conditionals**: I use a lot more than [2 conditions in my mappings](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/add-3rd-slot-for-modifier-conditions-in-controller-manager.325569/#post-1622169). To go around this I [squeezed multipe states into each modifier](https://www.traktorbible.com/en/squeezing-modifiers.aspx). Again, this added a lot of complexity to my mappings.
* **d) global modifiers:** I miss [global modifiers](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/named-variables-operators.326339/#post-1628411), to link the state in multiple pages. More info: page 87 of the [Rudi Elephant mapping](pics/RUDI-Js%20ELEPHANT%20TSI%20for%20VCI-400SE%20%2B%20Maschine%20(MK1)%20%2B%20BCR%202000%20v2.0.pdf).


## Some Limitations of BOME mappings

[BOME](https://www.bome.com/products/miditranslator) is essential to [build my new mappings](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Impossible-features). But it also have some improvement points.

In importance order:

* **A) Arrays**: [forum request](https://www.bome.com/support/kb/mt-pro-script-arrays). See also Bug#3 from the FAQ file.
* **B) Cascaded devices**: [forum request](https://www.bome.com/support/kb/cascaded-presets-loopback-devices)
* **C) More variables**: this is a lot more than Traktor, but still not enough as I'm emulating arrays

## How I see the future of Traktor mappings

A major Traktor strength is the MIDI mappings system. They are over and over praised to be very flexible and powerful.\
Traktor maps are by far the most popular in https://maps.djtechtools.com \
Large mappings are really complex to build - but once this is done other users immediately benefit by just installing them.

However the Traktor mappings system didn't get improvements for years, and [is is now quite old](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Traktor-limits).\
It now is also impossible to use it alone [to map the latest controllers](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Impossible-features).

For example in my DDJ-1000 mapping I had to use BOME midi translator as a middle man:\
https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9279

A second issue is that the most popular Traktor-ready controllers from NI did not got MIDI mapping capabilities at launch, and took quite a while to do so. 
In the case of the S5, this is still not possible (time of writing: May 2020)

In my view the mappings are a unique success story of Traktor. If improved, they could continue to give great results with just some minor quality-of-life changes.


# Hardware Controllers

## Why is DDJ-1000 my hardware of choice

Previously I explained [I why use Traktor](#why-is-traktor-my-software-of-choice). So why do I use it with a controller made for Rekordbox, instead of the S4Mk3??

Before we discuss this, please note that some years ago DJs could use any Software with any Hardware combination. 
This was a fully supported (and encouraged!) model by the vendors, which used this model to make real money from real customers. 

Having said this, the DDJ-1000 has major features that I personally value significantly over the S4Mk3:

* **A) BIG jogs wheels:** This is so important that [it gets a dedicated blog post ](#why-i-like-big-jogwheels)
  
* **B) More pad modes.** All my most useful functions are a maximum of 2 clicks away - and without using any shifts. 
  Main Pad modes are a) Hotcue, b) Roll/padFX, c) MacroFX, d) JogFX. 
  Pressing twice the same pad mode cycles the top 2 sub-pages of that pad mode. This is way the Reloop Elite mixer works. 
  I’ve got even more stuff on the secondary pad modes, accessible with a shift+mode. 

* **C) Two USB ports.** This is crucial for seamless hand-overs between DJs; and for safety of connecting a backup laptop ready at any time.
  
* **D) JogFX combos on the jogs.** Please see them in my demo videos (eg 6:32 of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tQZEHr8hk&t=392s ). 
  This is turnkey in my mapping, i’m not familiar if they have it on the S4mk3 (it was present for sure on the S4MK1 DJTT mappings)

* **E) BeatFx**. This is in the correct place of the mixer (lower right corner = right hand of the DJ), with a FX selector knob to select the effect by name

* **F) Connectivity**. Thr DDJ-1000 has more inputs and outputs, microphones etc. In particular, the mixer has a full FX suite for any external inputs (colorFX + beatFX)

Note: the S4mk3 is a fantastic controller - I have recommended it to several people before. In particular the loop/beatjump encoders implementation is the gold standard for that.\
The overall integration is better, of course, which is a plus if you prefer plug-and-play vs customization. 

But in the end its really the big jogwheels that is the crucial deal breaker; This was completely abandoned by NI in 2014 with the release of the S8, and was only picked-up in 2018 with the S4MK3 (although, in my opinion, still not the same as the DDJ-1000).


## DDJ-1000 comparison to DDJ-SZ and AKAI AMX

Besides [my DDJ-1000](#why-is-ddj-1000-my-hardware-of-choice), I have several other controllers fully [mapped to Traktor](#Free-mappings). 

Main differences are:

**DDJ-1000:**
* **Jogs:** CDJ big Jogwheels 
* **Screens:** Jog screens
* **Size**: More portable than SZ, but more cramped as well
* **BeatFX:** BeatFX in the lower right corner to the mixer

**DDJ-SZ:**
* **Size:** Very spacious. A joy to use!
* **Jogs:** Extra-smooth big Jogwheels
* **Filter:** Pioneer soundcolor FXs in hardware, including the Pioneer filter with a lot of Resonance

**AKAI AMX:**
* **Ultra portable:** The AMX replaces 4x devices: Z1 Mixer + X1 controller + Twister Fighter + Audio2. 
Its so small I carry it everywhere I go. 
* **DVS:** The AMX is the cheapest and smallest way to unlock DVS 
* **Mapping:** My mapping unlocks all TP3 functions

See also [this DDJ-SZ comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/c6vquf/help_me_ddj_sz_vs_ddj_1000/)
See also this general [comparison to CDJs](https://djtechtools.com/2017/07/23/ddj-cdjs-practicing-cdjs-pioneer-dj-controller/)



## Why I like BIG jogwheels

Spoiler: its not scratching!

I use jogs all the time in a controller - full list below. 
As I have big hands, I love them to be as BIG as possible.

There are the usages sorted by frequency:
* **#1: Tempo**: Adjusting tempo drift for older tracks (because of no elastic beatgrid)
* **#2: Cueing**: / fast preview to the exact spot where the track will start
* **#3: JogFX chains**: I do effects on the jog - see 6:32 of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tQZEHr8hk&t=392s
* **#4: Beagrids**: by far the quickest way to adjust beatgrids on the fly
* **#5: Scratch**: Very occasional live scratching / tricks  (see also [this post](#but-can-i-still-scratch-using-midi-how-much-is-the-latency-of-your-maps))

What I dont use on jogs:
* **Moving jogs**: these are cool, but not a deal-breaker for me
* **Haptic feedback**: this is basically a gimmick for me

## But can I still scratch using MIDI? How much is the latency of your maps?

**TL;DR:** YES you can scratch - as long you have a fast computer. Please see at 4:10 of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tQZEHr8hk&t=249) for a demo.\
Even better, try it [completely for free](#can-i-test-your-mappings-for-free), and see for youself.

**Long answer:**

Of course that If you are a 100% scratch DJ, then you should look for a native HID solution.\
But for the extreme vast majority of DJs I know, this solution is more than enough.

Some relevant points:
* Scratching is [only the 5th criteria for my jogwheels](#why-i-like-big-jogwheels)
* The [latest DDJ-1000 mapping](#What-are-the-features-of-your-DDJ-1000-Traktor-mapping) helps a lot. You can now can see the jog needle and your hand simultaneously.
* Pioneer has sold products with this solution for many years ([example](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/support/software-information/archive/ddj-sz/#traktor))

Some notes:
* **#1:** My guides covers all DDJ controllers. The only difference is the Aliases (page 10) and Output (page 28). The Annexes have specific pictures for specific DDJs.
* **#2:** This mapping requires the third-party BOME midi translator. It has a free trial for you to test this mapping before buying a license.
* **#3:** Issues? See the FAQ in a pdf, the “gotchas” on page 34, and reconfirm if you missed a step of this guide.

## Which are your Keyboard mappings?

### A) Beatgrid helper

**Links:**
*	Download Link: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9760

**Summary:**
*	Use this mapping to beatgrid your music in Traktor faster
*	Features: quick seek,  quick zoom, next song, shortcut, lock, auto, etc
*	All keys have a “faster” version using the shift

![](pics/beatgrid_helper_-_slide.jpg?raw=true)


### B) Transitions-Aligned Beatjumps

**Links:**
*	https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9762

**Summary:**
*	Use this mapping to prepare transitions-aligned beatjumps. This mapping lets you beatjump on both deck A and B simultaneously, so that you can put CUEs to align them
*	Row “one” of your keyboard beatjumps deck A; row “two” beatjumps deck B; row “three” beatjumps both decks simultaneously. Row “zero” controls the crossfader as well. 
*	EXAMPLE: please the transition around 52m of this mix.Song “A” is singing when “B” starts entering at 52m07s. For 30s, song “A” is singing normally. When “A” stops singing at 52m41s, “B” starts singing exactly at that time. This mapping helps a lot these fun transitions.


![](pics/transitions_aligned_beatJumps_-_slide.jpg?raw=true)



## What documentation comes with your mappings?

My zip files have **a lot** of documentation besides the TSI file.\
IMO it has no comparison to the typical mappings available on https://maps.djtechtools.com/ or https://www.traktorbible.com/freaks 

Included is:
* Quick reference (pictures only): [example](mapping_ddj_1000/DDJ-1000%20-%20Quick%20overview.pdf)
* User manual: [example](mapping_ddj_1000/DDJ-1000%20-%20Detailed%20manual.pdf)
* Installation manual: [example](mapping_ddj_1000/Installation%20Help/DDJ%20Mappings%20-%20Installation%20Guide.pdf)
* FAQ: [example](mapping_ddj_1000/Installation%20Help/DDJ%20Mappings%20-%20Frequently%20Asked%20Questions.pdf)

Plus:
* Technical info (to extend the mapping): [traktor_side](mapping_ddj_1000/Support%20files/Technical%20Info%20-%20Traktor%20side.txt) [bome_side](mapping_ddj_1000/Support%20files/Technical%20Info%20-%20BOME%20side.txt)
* Every single function: [example](mapping_ddj_1000/Support%20files/Source%20files/DDJ%20-%20Detailed%20reference.xlsx)

## Can I see a Demo video of your mappings?

Yes, please see the below Youtube videos. I have both long 30m videos where I cover every single function step-by-step, plus short "update" 5m video with the latest stuff only.

All videos are timestamp-tagged in Minute:second format, for you to find explanations of all specific.

## Can I test your mappings for FREE?

Yes. All my mappings work fine with the demo versions of both Traktor and BOME. So if you have these controllers you can just try them in no time. 

If you are considering buying equipment then I recommend that you test the mapping yourself in a shop showroom. I do this all the time before I buy anything (just mention this to the shop personnel).

Finally, all my mappings are a free gift to the community, to enable DJs to use their preferred Software with their preferred Hardware.

## What are the differences between MIDI mode and HID mode?

The DDJ-1000 can run in two different modes: MIDI or HID. 
The most obvious difference is the only HID has waveforms on the jog screens.

However there are many other smaller differences, summarized [here](https://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/ddj-1000#differences_between_midi_mode_and_hid_mode).

[original source](https://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/ddj-1000#differences_between_midi_mode_and_hid_mode)

## Missing jog screens on DDJ-800 and DDJ-1000SRT

Both the DDJ-800 and the DDJ-1000SRT do not have jog screens in MIDI mode. 

The reasons are:

* DDJ-800: 
  * this is due to a bug. The documentation describes the screens, but they are just broken.
  * to report this **yourself**, click [here](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72145/) and mention ticket "#147606"
* DDJ-1000SRT:
  * this is **not** a bug. It is a business decision of the Serato company.
  * to request this **yourself**, click [here](https://serato.com/forum/discussion/1736390/)

See also the next post for more details.

This is the [original list](https://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/ddj-1000#list_of_firmware_bugs_open_tickets) in the MIXXX wiki.
 
  
## Is the DDJ-1000SRT also mappable to Traktor?

**Yes.** I've updated [my SZ/SX2 mapping](#what-are-the-features-of-your-ddj-sx2--ddj-sz--ddj-srt-traktor-mapping)
to work on the SRT. 
Please see the demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU3QnOez56A&t=2s

Specific comments:
* **Jogs screens:** Jog Screens are NOT supported in MIDI. This is a business decision of the Serato company. 
  * If this affects you, please voice your opinion on this feature request thread: 
  * https://serato.com/forum/discussion/1736390
* **Pioneer Effects**: Mixer runs in external mode. This means that you have all pioneer effects for Traktor music. 
  * This is very different from the regular DDJ-1000, which runs in internal mode and only has Pionner beatFX in the master channel for Traktor sources.
* **Scratching:** Please put your jog weight to “heavy”.  This will significantly improve scratching and jogFX. Also please avoid VINYL OFF mode. The TSI disables jog touch in this case, but the jog loses resolution compared to VINYL ON mode;

## Is the DDJ-XP2 mappable to Traktor?

The XP2 is now really popular because its the cheapest way 
to unlock [Rekordbox V6 performance](#What-is-NOT-unlocked-in-the-Rekordbox-V6-hardware-options).
 
My [DDJ-1000 mapping](https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9279) is compatible with the XP1/XP2.\
So it will work. But it was not made specific to it, so some features might be missing.

Strong recommendation is to use v6.3.3 of my DDJ-1000 mapping.\
This is because later versions require [BOME](https://www.bome.com/products/miditranslator), 
are more complex [to install](mapping_ddj_1000/Installation%20Help/DDJ%20Mappings%20-%20Installation%20Guide.pdf), 
and focus on non-XP2-relevant features like the jog screens.
  
## Does (random DDJ controller) works with your mapping? Are the jogs good?

Pioneer has **dozens** of controllers. I own 3x of them, so ONLY there the mappings are 100% tight:
* DDJ-1000
* DDJ-SZ
* DDJ-SX2

The other controllers [are compatible](../ddj/1%20MIDI%20codes) - but there are always differences.\
**So for these [please try the mapping FOR FREE](#can-i-test-your-mappings-for-free) in a shop/friend.**

Once in a while I test controllers in a shop myself; ONLY in this case I describe the results in the first page of the mapping manual.\
The DDJ-1000SRT is a special case, [which I cover in detail here](#is-the-ddj-1000srt-also-mappable-to-traktor)


Regarding the Jogs: this is exactly the same story, plus the [all the comments about MIDI jogs](#But-can-i-still-scratch-using-MIDI-How-much-is-the-latency-of-your-maps)

## Read this if your Play button doesnt work

Are you using a custom mapping? Does some functions work but not the Play/Pause button?

This is a typical sign of a double installed mapping. Play works as a "toggle", so if its applied twice it cancels itself.

Solution:
* Delete all mapping pages in the controller manager
* install the desired mapping only once

## The great Sync debate 

### Audience point of view

About the "dj sync debate", I believe the following: 
a) all preparation that happens while the fader is **DOWN** is not relevant to the audience (see exception below)
b) everything that happens while the fader is **UP** is extremely relevant to the audience

The biggest exception to the above is that beatmatching takes a lot of time of the DJ. It is hard work. 
This time comes on top of track-searching and cueing tasks.

For some audiences like live-streaming, specialized non-commercial music styles, vinyl-only nights, etc they definitely appreciate the DJ to **look** and to **actually be** very busy.\  
To other audiences, this is not relevant at all.

Taking the above rule into account, I then believe the following:
* Beatmatching tracks that beatgrid well is just a waste of time
* Using sync on tracks that **do not** beatgrid well is very damaging
  * this is why elastic beatgrids are so important
* Some tricks typically associated with vinyl/beatmatching are definitely enjoyed by the audience, eg TT break / TT stop
* Beatmatching forces you to hear and known the tracks much better. It is a significant help in respecting and leveraging the phrasing structure of the tracks.


### DJ point of view

Typically the DJ has a different point of view than that of the audience. 

Beatmatching can range from being very enjoyable to being a burden. It definitely is a huge barrier to beginners that pursue this path.\  
DJs themselves tend to enjoy being busy, so beatmatching is one way to satisfy that need.\  
This also happens a lot with other topics like excessive use of EQ tuning, Effects, Scratching, sampling, etc.

In the end I recommend that you learn Beatmatching as a useful backup tool for the cases of 80s, live drummers, unanalysed tracks, older equipment, vinyl, acapellas, etc.

## Recommendation to DJTT DJ course

<https://store.djtechtools.com/products/dj-techtools-live-master-classes>

I've been very lucky to be in the first 2x interactive DJ course by Ean Golden. The level ranges from Intermediate to  Advanced, with an emphasis in advanced, which I really enjoyed.

An absolute bargain for the price, you get 6x completely interactive sessions where Ean explains extremly useful and real-world proven DJ techniques, covering the entire DJing spectrum.  
There you see Ean's real collection, tracks, cues and loops, where he shows over and over the techniques that he wrote in DJTT blog posts since 2007.  
<https://djtechtools.com/2015/05/17/the-history-of-dj-techtools/>

Even better, you can ask any question at any time. But crucially, the questions are moderated by RandomFPV (Chris Benoit), to ask them in the best order and at the best possible time. This SIGNIFICANTLY improves this process to be a lot more efficient and clear.

The cherry on top of the cake is an after-party zoom call where you discuss and interact these and other
 topics with your peers - the other students - from all over the world.

AFAIK this course and format is unique. It specifically targets intermediate and advanced levels. While very high-quality as well, AFAIK other courses are only prerecorded and are typically start at beginners and up.  
Nothing wrong with that, but I personally prefer this model and target audience a lot more.

Looking forward more follow-up courses, namely by other high-quality Tutors, in the same efficient format.

# Mappings Tricks

This section covers advanced mapping tricks. Most of these refer to the limitations of  modifiers. 


The second part of this section is are self-contained demos of **Advanced tricks**:
* **Preview Player:** https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/10915
* **Backwards loop and Reloop:** https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/10252
* **BOME access all 9x mixerFX:** https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/10575

## Modifier basics

Each page has 8 local modifiers. Each modifier stores 8 different states. 

If you run out of modifiers you could get 8 more by just creating another page.

However, this has the following implications:
* modifiers remain local per page - there are no global modifiers
* extra MIDI pages make your [preferences window slow](#Traktor-Slow-preferences-Window).

The remaining of this section explains how to go around these limitations.

  
## How to share modifiers by holding multiple states of different buttons

Typically you use one modifier per event you want tracked, with interaction "hold". This leds to the simplest usage by far.

For example:
* M1=“shift pressed”  (0=not pressed ; 1=pressed)
* M2=“jog pressed” (0=not pressed ; 1=pressed)

In this example you would effectively waste 12 states.

If the events are **independent,** you could share the modifier trivially by holding different values as follows:
* M1=0 -> nothing pressed
* M1=1 -> shift pressed
* M1=2 -> jog pressed

The issue is that this doesn't work for dependent events. Only the last state is remembered.

Example: If you press shift and then press the jog, you would forget that the shift is pressed. Worse, of you then release the shift while still pressing the jog, you now forget that the jog is still being pressed!

The way to fix this is to map all combinations that might happen:
M1=0 -> nothing pressed
M1=1 -> shift pressed, jog NOT pressed
M1=2 -> shift NOT pressed, jog pressed
M1=3 -> shift AND jog pressed

This no longer works with "hold" commands. In this case you have to map the whole state machine explicitly, by separating presses (AKA direct) and releases (AKA invert). Plus you also need to add conditionals to all events.

Example:
* IF M=0; IF press shift, THEN M=1
* IF M=1; IF press shift INVERT, THEN M=0
etc

Second, this trick leads to massive duplication on regular entries, because now actions that depend on the jog being pressed means "2" or "3"... and there is no “OR” operation in traktor. So the only way 

## How to add more than 8 states

Another trick: what to do if you need >8 states?
In this case, use 2 modifiers with a reserved state that means “locked”.
Ie, that the second modifier is being used to extend the states.
This leads to 7 usable states per modifier.
Example, imagine that “7” is the locked state.
The first 14 fully independent states would be:

M1=0, M2=7 (locked)
M1=1, M2=7 (locked)
...
M1=6, M2=7 (locked)
(notice the transition here)
M1=7 (locked), M2=0
M1=7 (locked), M2=1
...
M1=7 (locked), M2=6

  * extend a track that literally just ended;
  * extend a beat just before a breakdown
  * repeat a build-up several times
* Reloop: use this feature to return to a previous loop (just like CDJs)

# DJ collection converters

## What is the 26ms shift issue when converting cues/loops between softwares?

* We have found that 6% of the files have a shift of 26 milliseconds when going from Traktor to Rekordbox. The other 94% of the files will be fine.
* This shift is very noticeable and breaks beatgrids/loops. See below for a graphical example of this issue.
* Root issue is different interpretations of the **tricky MP3 LAME tag** (and their derivations  LACV/LAVF). Issues are:
* **Zero LAME CRC ("case c"):**
  * Traktor doesn't accept the LAME tag, but interprets the whole MPEG frame as "music", producing 26ms of garbage; 
  * Rekordbox the same, but skips the whole MPEG frame instead.
* **LAVC/LAVF reduced tags ("case b"):**
  * Traktor produces 26ms of garbage because it doesnt understand this tag; 
  * Rekordbox accepts the tag as a control frame
* Please see [this blog post](#which-dj-converters-avoid-the-26ms-shift-issue) to know who implemented this work


| Case | Signature  | TK->RB Correction  |
| ------ | ----- | ---- |
| case A | No headers | 0 ms |
| case B | Only xing OR lavc | 26 ms |
| case C | Invalid lame crc | 26ms |
| case D | Valid lame crc| 0 ms |


## 26ms shift issue links

* Analysis code: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pestrela/music_scripts/master

![26ms_problem](pics/26ms_problem.png?raw=true)

## 26ms shift algorithm

```
if mp3 does NOT have a Xing/INFO tag:
     case = 'A'
     correction = 0ms
 
 elif mp3 has Xing/INFO, but does NOT have a LAME tag OR has a lavc tag:
     case = 'B'
     correction = 26ms
 
 elif LAME tag has zero CRC or an invalid CRC:
     case = 'C'
     correction = 26ms
     
 elif LAME tag has valid CRC:
     case = 'D'
     correction = 0ms
```     
     

## Which DJ converters avoid the 26ms shift issue?

Historically, there was no way to convert your collection on Windows. The only converters available were for MacOS. This has now changed recently.\
All softwares take different approaches to solve the [26ms shift problem](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares).

This is the current situation as far as I tested it myself:
* **[DJ Data Converter](https://github.com/digital-dj-tools/dj-data-converter)**: This is a command line tool for Windows, WSL, and macOS. This is where the full research of the [26ms shift problem](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares) was done, and where it was first implemented. This is [another python converter](https://github.com/ErikMinekus/traktor-scripts/blob/master/playlist-export.py).
* **[Rekord Cloud](https://rekord.cloud/wiki/convert-library)**: This is a web application, so it supports all OSes. It also has many other useful features other than DJ conversion. The authors have [read the research](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares), implemented it for the 26ms case, and then extended it for virtualDJ with a 50ms value. As it is a web app, it created added an offline optional app just to scan shift mp3s.
* **[DJCU](https://www.facebook.com/DJConversionUtility/posts/568896026977298)**: This is a macOS-only application. Recently it got the hability to convert windows files, but still from macOS only. They have a manual tool to correct the shifts after conversion (REKU). More recently they correct shifts automatically using the encoder strings. This is something that I researched before and replaced with LAME/LAVC/LAVF tags instead.
* **[Rekordbuddy](https://next.audio/)**: This is also a macOS-only application. A Windows version is on the works for many years. This app corrects some shift cases correctly automaticlaly, but it misses others as well (when I tested it on a macOS VM).
* **[MIXXX](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2119#issuecomment-533952875)**: A new upcoming feature is reading Rekordbox-prepared USB sticks nativelly. This is of course affected by the 26ms problem. Like rekordcloud, the developers have [read the research](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares) and implemented it for their case (which depends on the several mp3 libraries they use).
* **[Mixo](https://support.mixo.dj/guides)**: To be tested. Mixo is an upcoming web application that does cloud-based conversion among many other features. At time of writing this is not publicly available. I've contated the team by email, and they told me they are aware of the 26ms shift issue.

## What is the source code that implements the 26ms algorithm?

I've aware of 4x different implementations of [the 26ms shift algorithm](#26ms-shift-algorithm)

* DJ Estrela
  * This is coded in bash, and parses the output of the eyeD3 and mp3guessenc tools to generate a CSV
  * <https://github.com/pestrela/music/blob/master/traktor/26ms_offsets/bin/mp3_check_encoder.sh#L813>
  * eyeD3 calculates the crc of the first 190 bytes, and then confirm if it matches the contents at byte 190:192
  * <https://github.com/nicfit/eyeD3/blob/master/eyed3/mp3/headers.py#L576>
* Mixxx
  * This is coded in C, and slightly modified from the mp3guessenc source
  * It was also extended to the offsets produced by 3 different decoders
  * <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/blob/fc9810508d92f702ead7ef9e63bb76f4afd6b245/lib/mp3guessenc-0.27.4/tags.c#L515>
  * <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2119#issuecomment-533952875>
* DJ Data converter:
  * This is coded entirely in Clojure
  * <https://github.com/digital-dj-tools/dj-data-converter/blob/master/src/converter/offset.cljc#L14>
  * <https://github.com/digital-dj-tools/mp3-parser/blob/master/src/mp3_parser/lame.cljc#L36>
* Rekordcloud:
  * Unknown language, because it is closed source. 
  * This was extended to virtualDJ as well, with the same concept of "cases"

## Rekorbuddy goes open-source

Rekordbuddy is going to be open source. See the DJworx article [here](https://djworx.com/teaser-free-world-exclusive-rekord-buddy-goes-open-source/)

Full support to this decision. Open-source enables Freedom to improve the code, which in turn drives distributed innovation. 

I already worked with other open-source projects dj-data-converter and MIXXX on the [26ms shift issue](#dj-collection-converters)
, and will do the same with rekordbuddy.

The request from Damien is clear: 

"I need help with support on the forums. I need help with the manual. 
I need help testing the app and I need help coding it to add new features. 
If you can help with any of these things, DM me here on the forums."

So please join this effort - 3 out of 4 of the above require no coding skills!

## How can I run CMDR in my macOS?

There is three ways to edit your mappings in macOS.

### Simplest: Xtrememapping


The simplest answer is: buy a copy of [XtremmeMapping](https://www.xtrememapping.com/) for macOS.

### More complex: Azure Cloud

The more complex answer is: get a free trial of a windows virtual machine. 

This will run in the "azure" microsoft cloud, and requires giving your credit card to detail to microsoft 
(they say over and over that no automatic billing will ever happen after the trial period without you changing your )

installation:
* link1: https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip246.html
* link2: https://www.techrepublic.com/article/build-your-own-vm-in-the-cloud-with-microsoft-azure/

Then connect to your cloud machine using RDP for mac:
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-remote-desktop-on-mac-what-you-need-to-know/

## How I build perfect tracklists using CUE files

I use a set of tools to generate a CUE file with the timings of my sets.
Once I have this file, I can generate tracklists with timestamps like in this example: https://www.mixcloud.com/dj_estrela/mix-17-cd07-trance-jun-2019/

Steps BEFORE the set (for prepared sets):
* group the files in folders, per style (Vocal Trance, Uplifting trance, etc)
* select the tracks and their order using winamp; Once this is OK, run "cue_renumber_files.py" and "cue_make_tracklist.sh".

Steps AFTER the set (both live sets and prepared sets):
* convert the NML to a text tracklist using https://slipmat.io/playlists/
* listen the recording in winamp to spot major mistakes. Tag the locations in MMM:SS format. At the end, use "cue_convert_timestamps.sh" to convert to HH:MM:SS format
* open the huge WAV file in Adobe audition, and perform the following:
  * normalize volume of all tracks
  * fix any obvious mistakes if necessary (eg, track ended too early when playing live, etc)
  * tag the divisions of the tracks inside the wav file
* convert the tags inside the WAV into a CUE file, using this software: http://www.stefanbion.de/cuelisttool/index_e.htm
  * note: this software fails on files bigger than 2Gb (https://forums.adobe.com/thread/309254). Workaround is splittingthe file at the 3hour mark, exactly, then use an option in cue_merge_cues.py to add this offset back in the second file
* convert the tags inside the WAV into a CUE file, using this software: http://www.stefanbion.de/cuelisttool/index_e.htm
* merge the CUE file with the Tracklist file using cue_merge_cues.py
* upload the mix to http://mixcloud.com/dj_estrela
* transfer the mix automatically to https://hearthis.at/djestrela/#sets
  
  
Overview of the Cue tools:

* **cue_renumber_files.py:**
  * renumbers mp3 files, in sequence. This is useful to make a sequenced playlist in your operating system folders, outside Traktor.
* **cue_make_tracklist.sh:**
  * from a folder, generates basic tracklist text files
* **cue_convert_timestamps.sh:**
  * convert MMM:SS to HH:MM:SS format. Winamp uses the first format, Adobe audition uses the second 
* **cue_merge_cues.py:**
  * this is the main tool. It merge back and forth any CUE file with any tracklist text file. 
    It can read either case from separate or single files. It also cleans the artist - title fields, and generates timestamped tracklists 
* **cue_rename_cue.sh:**
  *  matches the CUE file contents with the FILE tag. This is useful when you rename the files externally.

## How much time do you take to make each mix
  
A LOT of time. Much much more than simply the running time of each mix.  
I'm always easily preparing/recording/finishing say 8 mixes at a time, 
so the whole process for any given mix can easily take months.

Why so much time? Is is worth it?  
You tell me :). Check for yourself in <https://djestrela.com/>. List of styles are in the bottom of this post.

In short all my mixes are carefully planned [to tell a story](https://djtechtools.com/2013/10/13/the-stage-principle-playing-a-show-with-your-music/),
by focusing on a specific [overall theme](#Retro-Remixes) or [sub-sub-style](https://hearthis.at/djestrela/set/djestrelatrancevocal/).
All my mixes are post-mastered with a single loundness, and feature a [clean tracklist](https://github.com/pestrela/music/blob/master/tracklists/DJ%20Estrela%20-%20Karas%20Club%20Remember%20-%20Mar%202020.txt) and [whole lyrics](https://github.com/pestrela/music/blob/master/tracklists/DJ%20Estrela%20-%20Karas%20Club%20Remember%20-%20Mar%202020.lyrics).

I've built some [software tools]() to speedup some parts of this process.

Major styles in <https://djestrela.com/>:
* Trance 
  * Vocal Trance
  * Uplifitng Trance
  * Tech Trance
* 80s:
  * Italo Disco
  * Rock FM
  * "regular" 80s Pop and Rock
* Top-40
  * Commercial House, per decade
  * Latin / Reggaeton
  
See below for a much more detailed version of this post.

## How much time do you take to make each mix - Worst case

In the worst case I take months to do a single 90 minute set. This post describe all steps of such mix.

Preparation:
* find music:
  * 
* collect 
* group the files in folders, per style (Vocal Trance, Uplifting trance, etc)
* select the tracks and their order using winamp; Once this is OK, run "cue_renumber_files.py" and "cue_make_tracklist.sh".

Regarding DJ software, it useful for companies to jumpstart their innovation with open source technology.
For new stuff [like STEMS realtime generation](#How-to-create-your-own-karaoke-files-automatically-using-Stems-and-AI) 
it is far quicker to use this, than to developing your own technology.

The MIT license choose by Spleeter its very permissive and has very few conditions:
https://choosealicense.com/licenses/

This is a general example where you just need to attribute things:\
"Third Party Software Acknowledgements"
https://www.denondj.com/product-legal-sc5000-prime

Compare this to the GPL, where you need to make your own code that extends it GPL as well:

## What shortcuts you added for Youtube, Google and Discogs?

[This folder](../downloads) contains Windows tweaks and other generic tools.

My [autohotkey file (AHK)](../downloads/AutoHotkey.ahk) has all kinds of 
useful *global* shortcuts that *work for any text of any program*.\  
All these shortcuts operate in a single line, or a list of lines:
* CTRL+F08: Search in Google
* CTRL+F09: Search in File Explorer
* CTRL+F10: Search in Soulseek
* CTRL+F11: Get current URL
* CTRL+F12: Search in Youtube (first hit)
* Win+backspace: toggle any window to be "always on top"
* Win+Arrows: Arrange windows on the corners, 3 possible sizes. Also supports regular half-screen
* Win+Insert: **Append** a copy to the clipboard. Really useful to collect things around and paste once

Using Shift you get varitions of the above:
* CTRL+SHIFT+F08: Search in Discogs
* CTRL+SHIFT+F11: Get all tabs url
* CTRL+SHIFT+F12: Search in Youtube (list)

More scripts in this folder:
* a youtube-dl wrapper
* a tool to search 1001tracklists, ticketswap and DJ TechTools maps.

## How to optimize a laptop for DJ Software - Summary
  
Every year laptops have more and more Power saving tricks.\
These tricks are *VERY* damaging for DJ software.\

For a demo of theses issues please see at 1:20 of https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=85&v=ijFJZf_KSM8

Below some *quick fixes* to try first you have crackle / glitches / noise:

* a) *Continuous* crackle when playing:
  * Raise the driver buffer
* b) Crackle when when *moving the Jogs*:
  * Disable turbo boost ([steps](#how-to-avoid-crackle--glitches--noise-on-windows-by-disabling-intel-turbo-boost))
* c) *Random* crackle:
  * Disable wireless
  * Update the BIOS and all Drivers from your laptop manufacturer
  * Disable all power saving features (Turbo boost, Speedsteep, USB selective sleep, ...)
  
if not enough, then please read below  
  

## How to optimize a laptop for DJ Software - Complex case
  
If the quick fixes above were not enough then there is **no easy solution**. 

The way forward is complex:
* **Measure:** Measure the problems using [LatencyMon], [DPCLatency], [IDLT] and [SMI_reporter] to establish an objective baseline
* **Performance Guides:** Study performance guides that are specific to audio
* **Update log:** Study update logs to understand what changed when. This list can be quite big. 
* **Disable drivers:** disable the drivers one by one measuring in between 
* **Downgrade drivers:** as above, but downgrading components one by one while re-measuring 
* **Low-level Trace:** Generate a trace of the whole system using Windows Performance tools

Again: measurement is crucial to control every change to the system.
  
## How to avoid crackle / glitches / noise on Windows by disabling Intel turbo boost?

If you have an HP laptop and have crackle when move the jogs you have to disable Intel turbo boost.

There are 3 ways to disable turbo boost:
a) Specific program (best way): Use the "Quick CPU" software: https://www.coderbag.com/product/quickcpu
b) Set windows power to 99% CPU: [guide](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015455971-To-those-who-have-crackling-noise-when-using-DDJ-1000-with-rekordbox-dj)
c) BIOS config: https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/203057850-PC-Optimization-Guide-for-Windows

Macs have turbo boost, but are not affected. Anyway, the way to disable is [here](https://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-enable-or-disable-turbo-boost-on-mac/)

## Dell laptop pre-installed services latency issues

If you have a Dell laptop, **beware of the services that come preinstalled with the laptop**.

Specifically I've measured that "Dell SupportAssist" causes SECONDS of latency every 30 minutes, due to heavy [SMI interrupts](#How-to-count-SMI-hidden-interrupts-in-Windows)

The solution is simply to disable the Dell services in "services.msc"

**More details:** [smi_counter](https://github.com/pestrela/smi_counter)
 
![dell_support_assist3](https://github.com/pestrela/smi_counter/blob/master/dell_support_assist3.jpg?raw=true)




## How to count SMI (=hidden interrupts) in Windows

If your whole laptop stops once in a while for several seconds - including the mouse - it can be [SMI issues](https://www.resplendence.com/latencymon_cpustalls).

SMIs are "hidden interrupts" that the BIOS can issue at any time and will *lock all cores*.
As these are not visible to the OS, these will confuse latencyMon, but not [IDLT](https://www.resplendence.com/latencymon_idlt).

These interrupts are used, for example, when you change the laptop brightness. 
The CPU has a special counter for these interrupts. 

I've made a small tool to read this special counter in Windows: [count_smi tool](https://github.com/pestrela/smi_counter) 

Below a simple test that shows that changing the brightness in Dell XPS "costs" 4 SMIs:

![dell_smi_light_problems](https://github.com/pestrela/smi_counter/blob/master/pics/dell_smi_counter.jpg?raw=true )
                           

## How to make a deep trace of everything that runs in your laptop
   
TODO: document the windows performance analyser   
   
   
## Read this if you have erratic USB cable problems

USB cables may be too thin and not deliver enough power to your controller.\
Confirm your cable does NOT have these labels:
* 28/2C
* 28AWGX2C
* AWG 28X2C
 
In general you want the "2C" label to have "24" and not "28".

Even in the case your device is externally powered, a bad cable may still have data issues.

In this case use this info as an heuristic: a cheap cable that is poor for delivering power is also probably cheap on the data side.

## How to enable Traktor verbose log

**important:** this will affect performance, so use only for manual tests!

log file: traktor_root\log\traktor.log
    
Windows:
*  TBD

MacOS:
*  close traktor
*  go to User:Library: Preferences:com.native-instruments.de:Traktor.plist
*  add key Log.Verbosity with value 5
*  default value: 2
      
## Buying a laptop for Audio

**Update Oct 2020:** I highly recommend you buy the XMG windows laptop 
[specially tuned and guaranteed by Ray Arkaei](https://djworx.com/the-xmg-dj-15-one-laptop-to-rule-them-all/).

---

Are you going to buy a laptop? Be sure you can return it to the shop if you have any problems.

My advice if you are buying a Windows laptop is the following:
* Check latest guides to choose a laptop
  * Ensure that it has USB-A ports. No exceptions.
* Buy such model in a real shop where you can return it in 30 days **without any questions asked**
  * Enquire this question specifically!
* Measure DPC problems continuously - including overnight - for Latencymon, SMI_counter
* If you have any problems return the laptop, or follow my guides to fix the issues.
 
## reseting your low-level settings and controller of your MAC 

The system management controller (SMC) handles the following tasks of your mac:
* Responding to presses of the power button
* Responding to the display lid opening and closing on Mac notebooks
* Battery management
* Thermal management
* SMS (Sudden Motion Sensor)
* Ambient light sensing
* Keyboard backlighting
* Status indicator light (SIL) management
* Battery status indicator lights
* Selecting an external (instead of internal) video source for some iMac displays

if you have issues related to power, batteries, fans, etc, resting this can fix it.
* SMC reset: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201295
* guide2: https://www.howtogeek.com/312086/how-and-when-to-reset-the-smc-on-your-mac/

NVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory) and PRAM (Parameter RAM) are a small amount of 
memory that your Mac uses to store settings like sound volume, display resolution, 
startup-disk selection, time zone, and recent kernel panic information. 

If you need to reset these settings, follow this guide:
* PRAM reset: <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063>

# Windows usage

* [How to add WSL scripts to QQTabBar](#How-to-add-WSL-scripts-to-QQTabBar)


## Why I use Windows instead of Mac
    
Apple and MacOS is in general a better choice to do audio work (both DJing and Production). 

The operating system is stronger because it was built on Unix. The hardware and software are better 
integrated as they are built by the same company. 
And there is generally less bugs across the board as the hardware are standardized (ie, all macs are the same inside the same model).

Nevertheless its definitely not perfect; while I've seen more issues in Windows, I've also seen issues in Macs. 
In particular, as of Nov 2019 this got a lot worse with MacOS Catalina, namely as it migrated to 64-bit only drivers and the removal of itunes/music App. 

So if I say the mac is still overall a better choice for Music, so why I'm using a Dell XPS 15 windows? 
Main reasons are:
* **a) Folder Tree:** I use File explorer with the [full tree visible all the time](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only). I've tried Finder several times but did not enjoyed their paradigms. 
Also tried to use a windows file explorer clone for mac, it was completely abandoned by the author.
* **b) No flexibility:** AKA the "one apple way". I've never got used to their GUI, their keyboard shortcuts, 
and the keyboard itself. 
In particular there is the extremely annoying decision of having to use 2 hands for the
 [forward delete key](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/why-no-delete-key.1360799/). 
Same story for the Maximize feature. Same story for lack of USB-A ports, SD cards and dongles. 
Ditto for no headphone jack in recent iphones.
In all cases the answer is  "get used to it". Well, I didn't.\
See also [my Windows tweaks](#Generic-Windows-tweaks-and-programs-I-use)
* **c) Software library:** Very limited choice on software and freeware, as compared to Windows
* **d) Expensive:** Underpowered machines, when compared to their direct windows counterparts [in the same price range](https://musiccritic.com/equipment/disk-jockey/best-laptops-for-djing/)
* **e) Command Line:** I use the command heavily to automate tasks in bash, git updates, and python programming.

## How to use QQTabBar with multiple tabs, folder bookmarks and program launchers

QQTabbar ([link to a review](https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/qttabbar.htm)) is 
an amazing file explorer add-on. It supports multiple tabs, folder bookmarks and program launchers.\
I use this every day to open WSL linux terminals in the current folder, and to open audio files programs directly.

Usage:
![qqtabbar_usage](pics/qqtabbar_usage.jpg?raw=true)

Configuring Launchers:
![qqtabbar_launchers](pics/qqtabbar_launchers.jpg?raw=true)

## How to add WSL scripts to QQTabBar

Combining QQTabBar and WSL bash scripts is a powerful way to manipulate files in Explorer.

Example programs from [here](../wsl_tools/):
* windows_launch_spek.sh: calls the spek frequency analyzer for several files
* windows_group_files_in_folder.sh: create a sub-folder and move selected files into it 
* simple WSL shell launch on that folder

Most important tricks are:
* launch bash as 'wsl.exe --cd %cd% -- <your_script> %f%'
  * '--cd %cd% --' changes the working folder to that location
  * without further parameters this opens an interactive shell
* process the files with "wslpath $file" to convert to WSL format
  * if you are launching windows programs, use the arguments "as-is"

## Issues of the V6 Rekordbox migration - Major

1) **Vendor Lock-in:**
* V6 encrypts the database and removed the XML export option.
  * Discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/g11s3l
  * Workaround: https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/g2c9l9
* This vendor lock-in doesn't look good on latest European regulations:
  * "To eliminate vendor lock-in practices, the Regulation provides for and encourages 
  the development of codes of conduct for service providers. With these codes of conduct, 
  consumers should be able to switch to other service providers more easily."
  * source: https://www.gtlaw-amsterdamlawblog.com/2018/11/another-privacy-regulation-but-this-time-on-non-personal-data/

2) **Perpetual bought licenses** do not transfer to subscription model:
* I've bought a rekordbox performance (149 USD), rekordbox video (99USD)and RMX pack (9.9USD) to use in my DDJ-1000.\
  * Total cost: 260USD w/o Tax.
  * V5 licenses: https://web.archive.org/web/20200217154645/https://rekordbox.com/en/plan/pluspacks/
* This V5 license doesn't carry over to the new subscription model
  * Note: "check" in this table means that it is suported. It doesn't mean it is free! (https://rekordbox.com/en/support/link )
  
The XML vendor lock is a **deal breaker** for me.\
The dead V5 license is quite annoying (there will be no V5 improvements and I don't expect any support moving forward).
  
## How did the industry commenters reacted to the v6 XML export issue?

(Post to be updated periodically. Please send updates to pedro.estrela@gmail.com)

* DJ Worx: <https://djworx.com/atgrs-6tox-scales-the-rekordbox-6-walled-garden/>
  * "as each manufacturer continues to build higher walls around their ecosystems to keep you trapped inside. "
  * "will only last as long as Pioneer DJ doesn’t change the encryption key, which could be tomorrow or could be never."
  * "This alone tells me that this is a totally pointless method on Pioneer DJ’s part and that they need to change, or ideally ditch encryption completely."
* Digital DJ Tips: <https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2020/04/rekordcloud-mixo-apps-offer-new-dj-library-conversion-tools/>
  * "What about this Rekordbox 6 issue? none of the conversion apps out there old or new except Rekordcloud works with Rekordbox 6 exporting, because your data is locked down inside Rekordbox 6 in a way it wasn’t in previous versions."
* DJ Tech Tools: <https://djtechtools.com/2020/04/14/rekordbox-6-now-with-cloud-library-syncing/>
  * (issue was not specifically covered AFAIK)
* DJCU: <https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/g11s3l/xml_implicationslimitations_of_the_new_rekordbox/>
  * "Call to arms: I ask all DJs regardless if they use my tools or not, ask Pioneer DJ to bring the export to XML function back, and while at it, ask them to fix the XML import. Don't go mad at Pulse"
* Rekordcloud: <https://rekord.cloud/blog/technical-inspection-of-rekordbox-6-and-its-new-internals>
  * "It could be different: In case Pioneer reads this: do the right thing and open up Rekordbox."
* Rekordbuddy: <https://forums.next.audio/t/rekord-buddy-and-rekordbox-6-do-not-upgrade-for-now/2257/15>
  * "I’ve always done things by the book with Rekord Buddy and so my first reaction is to make we stay within the law here."
* Mixo: <https://support.mixo.dj/guide/rekordbox-6?search=9676776fd018f4b4ec565dcf1c1db0f6>
  * "We would recommend that users who wish to move their Rekordbox collections to other DJ Software avoid updating to Rekordbox 6"

My own comment is the following:
* Pedro Estrela:  https://djworx.com/traktor-s4-mk3-screen-hack-hits-version-2-0/
  * "MIXXX is fully open. After the RB6 database encryption story last week, and all this years of Traktor workarounds, it looks the best way forward."
  

## Issues of the V6 Rekordbox migration - Minor
  
Besides the XML export and the v5 licenses problems, there are additional smaller issues:  
no search box on the explorer node; no midi mapping with modifiers, multiple actions and CFX selector;  
Cannot physically delete files inside RB. Still hotcues do not move the floating cue.

Also there is a bug since 5.6.1 when [importing XML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV89dj1hDWM).  
(note: do not confuse the v5.6.1 XML **import** bug with the v6 missing XML **export** issue.) 

On the **plus side**, it now automatically auto-relocate renamed and moved tracks. 
This is a [major improvement](#why-is-traktor-my-software-of-choice-a-automatic-finds-moved--renamed-files-mass-relocate).  
It also has shared audio and video playlists.  
It also has a Day skin, which is something [all OS already support](#How-to-enable-day-skin-in-any-software)  

The other functions I either do not use (streaming, ableton link) or have my own solution ([automatic sync using a NAS](#how-i-synchronize-and-backup-my-whole-traktor-music-and-configuration-across-laptops-and-a-nas)).
 
 
## What is NOT unlocked in the Rekordbox V6 hardware options

With v6 there are combinations of equipement that unlock *some* functionality.
* Plans: https://rekordbox.com/en/plan/
* Hardware: https://rekordbox.com/en/support/link

Combining both lists, this is what is **NOT unlocked**:
* DVS (except DJM-750Mk2, 450, 250MK2, interface2, DDJ-RZ, XP1, XP2)
* Video (except RXZ)
* Sampler sequence saving
* RMX effects
* Lyrics
* Cloud Sync

All these need either the 10eur/mo or the 15eur/mo subscription (August 2020 new prices)

For example, this is how video looks like with my DDJ-1000 connected:\
"You cannot use this function in your current plan."\
![v6_video_watermark](pics/v6_video_watermark.jpg?raw=true)

Same story for DVS:\
![v6_dvs_with_ddj_1000](pics/v6_dvs_with_ddj_1000.jpg?raw=true)


## How to ignore Rekordbox upgrades completely

The last usable Rekordbox is version v5.6.0.\
Later versions either have a bug on [XML import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV89dj1hDWM), 
or they [lack XML export](#issues-of-the-V6-Rekordbox-migration---major) at all.

However, you will be nagged with an upgrade window every time you start RB.

to remove this, simply rename this file to something else:

C:\Program Files\Pioneer\rekordbox 5.6.0\Upmgr rekordbox.exe
    
   
## How to enable day skin in any software and any OS

If you are playing on the bright outside you will not see a thing.
Some softwares provide a really convenient skin for this situation.

But this feature is already native to the OS: 

Windows 10:
* Press Win + Plus / settings / Invert Colors / Turn on magnifier
* [guide](https://windowsreport.com/inverted-colors-windows-10/)

MacOS:
* “System Preferences” > “Keyboard” > “Shortcuts” > “Accessibility” >  “Invert Colors
* [guide](https://devicebar.com/invert-display-colors-on-apple-mac-os-x/2642/)
    
Second, there are freeware programs that are better, by only inverting the brightness and keepng the hues as they are 
(ie, green, yellow, red colors are unchanged). See [NegativeScreen for Windows](https://zerowidthjoiner.net/negativescreen)

    
# MIXXX topics

This section covers MIXXX, the open-source professional DJ software.
* [What makes MIXXX unique](#what-makes-mixxx-unique)
* [How complete is MIXXX?](#how-complete-is-mixxx)
* [DDJ support in MIXXX](#ddj-support-in-mixxx)



## What makes MIXXX unique 

[MIXXX](https://mixxx.org/) is a professional-level DJ software that is fully open-source software.

This means that ANYONE has the complete freedom to improve MIXXX by fixing bugs, extending features or adding entirely new functionality.

Such is unique among any solution, and is severely lacking in all other DJ software that have bugs unfixed for years ([example](#Traktor-Slow-preferences-Window)), possibly forever.

Also interesting, MIXXX is provided at no cost to the users. Anyone can just download, and have a go at it.


## How complete is MIXXX?

Out of the box, MIXXX has a very impressive number of advanced DJ features:
* DVS control to any soundcard
* BPM, Key detection and Sync 
* A very complete list of effects
* DJ controller support, both built-in and contributed, and a mapping wizard for new controllers.

It has [dozens more DJ standard features](https://mixxx.org/features) as well like Loops, Sampler, HotCues, Quantize, Censor, EQ, etc.

I've made a review of MIXXX 2.3 from the point of view of a heavy Traktor user:
* old link: https://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=13355
* new link: https://mixxx.discourse.group/t/my-first-mixxx-experience-coming-from-traktor/18419
    
Another Traktor vs MIXXX comparison: https://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=13267    

    
## DDJ support in MIXXX
    
MIXXX has good support for the simplest DDJ controllers like 400, RB and SB2 ([full list](https://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/pioneer_ddj_controllers)).
On the 4 Deck controllers it supports the SX, which is compatible to the other S-based controllers like the SX2 and SZ.

For the [DDJ-1000](https://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/ddj-1000) there is a first mapping with the [jog screens](https://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=13346).

I intend to contribute to MIXXX my own DDJ-1000/SX2/SZ mappings soon, based on my [Traktor mappings experiences](#Free-Mappings).

## MIXXX compilation on windows

These links explain how to compile mixxx in windows:
* https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/compiling_on_windows
* https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/Build%20Windows%20installer
* https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/visual_studio_community

Potentially, compiling in the WSL could have simpler dependencies:

## What are Retro, Metal and Reggae remixes

### Retro Remixes
I'm a big fan of Retro remixes ([wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80%27s_remix)). 
These are remixes of modern tracks with typical 80s sounds, but with the original vocal.\
Good artists  to check are 
[Exile](https://www.youtube.com/user/dima839/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid),
[Initial Talk]( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-zc27zh_-_x0UI7wiqAg7w/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid),
[Tronicbox](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB3W9gT-mFMN1j12pydSNOw/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid )
and [SX Ade Synthwave](http://youtube.com/channel/UCcG7Yj2yVP_11oy9D7nLbkQ/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid ).\
[Loki](https://www.youtube.com/user/patryk1997100/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid)
and [Sagkra]( https://www.youtube.com/user/sakgramixesII/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid) have 
only a few retro remixes, but there they are **rely really good**.\
Full playlists: 
[Playlist 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR6iLyPrwbYO0xGzpVUDTJrD4lTs3r7lU ), 
[Playlist 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLccRgYlrdQ0imAehsQXmtKgJ3Zstt26Et ),
[Playlist 3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsqzrF7W4SoxB9uWJdHbVoPR2hU5n1tcO ),

### Metal Remixes


Similar is Metal remixes. In that style, people transform modern tracks in to Hard Rock/Metal style.
There it ranges from playing the guitars/drums on top of the track, all the way to remaking the whole track.\
Good authors to check are [Sindre Myskja](https://www.youtube.com/user/sindremyskja/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid) (this is the best one by far),
[Danny Killian](https://www.youtube.com/user/danyTWIG/videos)) (note: a lot of videos were deleted), 
[Bliix]( https://www.youtube.com/user/bliix/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid)
[Jotun studio]( https://www.youtube.com/user/Jotun6662/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid),
[Nanock](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxSoglV-neBcp_6aVTPFSlg/videos).\
Full Playlists: [Playlist 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLipQ7AgcsE&list=RDXLipQ7AgcsE )

### Reggae Remixes

Same idea is reggae remixes.
Again, modern tracks are remixed with the typical reggae sounds, but with the original vocal.\
Good authors to check are [Theemotion]( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXxbs26yQ9BUwVLIUpOVf3w/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid ),
[Jr Blender]( https://www.youtube.com/user/thatshitissowild/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid),
[Chala](  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpXSNWccH_2ONpP3zTig2_g/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid),
[Ganja music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsLQbyCDWjYluA3N0khGIQ)
 and [BillyBoy](https://soundcloud.com/billyboyfiji679 ) \
Full Playlist: [Playlist 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_j7AhQRzKg ), 

  
## Examples of Retro, Metal and Reggae remixes
 
The fundamental aspect in all these styles - Retro remixes, Metal versions and Reggae remixes - is that the original vocal are used.
As such, it typically departs from [regular covers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version) sung by other artists.


Below some examples of both styles, compared to the original versions:

Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper - Shallow 
* shallow original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo_efYhYU2A
* shallow 80s version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRJIIubEZ-c

Examples Reggae remixes - TBD.


## How to learn good transition points by reconstructing sets

One great way to learn good mixing points is to recreate existing mixes made by others, for learning purposes.

In 1995 I've heard my favorite mixed CD ever: "Kaos Totally Mix 1, mixed live by Dj Vibe at Kremlin, Lisbon, Portugal."
In the last 25 years, I listened to this CD at least 75 times, probably a lot more.

But only by recreating the mix first in Adobe Audition and then in Traktor I found (all?) the technical tricks of the amazing work by Dj Vibe. Amazing work!!

Versions:
* This is the original mix in youtube, uploaded by Kaos Records Portugal
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuun-IcRuTw
* This is a pack with all the individual tracks with their traktor cues. 
  * Please match as follows: 1<->5 / 2<->6 / 3<->7 / 4<->8; 
  * some cues are gradual IN/OUT fades, some are already open faders.
  * https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bg4ey3z8uieis0e/AABlZeCqyskOgKWyjlXdsphVa?dl=0

**IMPORTANT:** ALL TRACKS ARE COPYRIGHT 1995 [KAOS RECORDS](http://bit.ly/KaosRecords).\
Tracks were recorded from vinyl for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.** ([Fair use disclaimer](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/fair-use-disclaimer/)).


![kaos CD cover](pics/kaos_totally_mix_reconstruction_cd_cover.jpg?raw=true)
![kaos audition](pics/kaos_totally_mix_reconstruction_audition.jpg?raw=true)

## Identify generational gaps in music

Some tracks are very well knon, some disapeear completely.
This is a fun test for you to try and learn.

## How I recorded my old radio show recordings and found the IDs

I had old K7s mixtapes from around 1996 from local radio shows that I really liked. 
These shows have significantly shaped my electronic music tastes. 
Recently I've took the time to preserve these relics, and find the IDs for the tracks that I've been looking for 22 years. 

The steps were:
* I've first recorded all my 15 cassettes in a single go. 
* Then added the cues in adobe audition. 
* Then split it by mix sessions. Sometimes it were just isolated tracks, sometimes it was a sequence of 10 tracks. 
* Then I've combined these into packs of 2 hours each. The first pack is now online: https://www.mixcloud.com/Dj_Estrela_House/radio-cidade-superpista-1997-recordings/ 
* Them made the known tracklist and exact timestamps using a CUE file

Regrading the IDs:
* I've first extracted JUST the IDs into yet another pack. 
* This was uploaded to mixcloud:   https://www.mixcloud.com/Dj_Estrela_House/superpista-ids-1997-recordings-full-versions/
* Benefits:
  * its much easier to show to knowledgeable DJs in a single go
  * mixcloud is able to identify some tracks for you

## How I edited my videos showing the Traktor screen 

On my latest demo videos I show both the controller and the traktor screen simultaneously. It looks pretty cool.
To get the basic idea, see this DJ tech tools article: https://djtechtools.com/2012/06/24/how-to-make-a-great-dj-video/
This is another one: https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2019/02/how-to-film-your-dj-mixes-using-your-phone/
This specifically covers [smartphone placement](https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2020/05/overhead-camera-for-djs/)

Concrete steps:

* Equipment
  * Smartphone
  * As much illumination as possible
  * Buy a microphone stand with a strong hold: [example](https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Microphone-Suspension-Broadcasting-Voice-Over/dp/B00DY1F2CS/)
  * Buy a smartphone flexible tripod:  [example](https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Octopus-Adjustable-Cellphone-Smartphone/dp/B06XRFC75Y/)

* Recording  
  * Put the smartphone as high as possible, and with the most illumination possible
  * Grab the stand to a Tall chair, or to another fixed desk
     * The crucial idea is that your scratching will not vibrate the smartphone
  * Record the controller image in 16:9 format
  * Record the laptop screen using [this free tool](https://www.freescreenrecording.com/)
  * If its a tutorial spoken video, record the audio from the smartphone. If its pure DJing record the audio in a third channel from the Traktor or the mixer output
    * Important: record all inputs **with sound**, even if only the Traktor recording will be the final. 
    * This will grealty simplify the tricky syncronization step
    
* Editing part 1: merge everything to a single video
  * Download the latest version of [openshot](https://www.openshot.org/download/). 
  Read this [tutorial for basics](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/an-introduction-to-video-editing-in-openshot-2-0/). 
  [this is another tutorial](https://gist.github.com/peanutbutterandcrackers/f0f666243133e0ed25abbc12a4ba23d7) 
  * Use only 4:3 profiles so that you can fit the controller, the GUI, and a black banner at the very for your logo + Captions.
  * To significantly speedup processing, use lower resolution profiles:
    * Quickest editing: "QVGA 29.7 fps 320x240"
    * Quick editing: "768x568 4:3 PAL"
    * Export quality: "1024x768, 4:3 30fps"  
      * Create a new profile in your documents / .openshot / profiles folder, based on another 16:9 HQ profile)
  * Add the Controller video on Track 1. Zoom out (ctrl+Scroll). Click in the very first frame. 
  Use properties / Rotate to fix any rotation issues.
  On properties, set "crop X", "crop Y", "crop Height" and "Crop Width" to crop the controller to size.
  Use right click / transform to center and scale it to the half bottom of the screen.
  Use effects/Brightness to raise the light a bit. You can never get enough lighting.
  * If the controller moves around when playing, you did NOT clicked in the very first frame
    * another sign is that there is very small green dots in the timeline. These are called "keyframes" 
    * to fix this, RMB the changed properties, "remove keyframe", potentilly several times
    * then edit the properties ONLY on the first frame
  * Move the video to the middle of the timeline. Lock track 1 so that it no longer moves (track 1 / RMB / lock)
  * Add the Screen video to Track 2. Do the same steps as before to crop and scale / center the video on the top part of the screen
  * In VLC, sync the two videos by finding something unique (eg pressing play). Zoom in a lot. Get the HH:MM:SS values, and calculate the offset in seconds
  * In Openshot, manually align the videos using this info. Disable snap for precise alignment. Turn on volume in all tracks for this operation only. Confirm that the alignment is good in the end of the video as well
  * In the black bar above the GUI, add your logo and the title
    * add this to another track (shift+t)
  * In Powerpoint: Create some very big arrows in all 4 directions, set transparent color, generate individual PNGs from it
  * Move the arrows around to identify particular things in the GUI and the controller (other than your mouse)
  * Render the final video in high quality MP4
 
* Editing part 2: captions, cuts, effects, transitions, etc
  * Get windows essentials 2012 [archive link](https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/104887-can-i-get-movie-maker-win10-again.html#post1304260); install only windows movie maker 2012.
  * To create separators: home / add / title; Then animations / wipe right / normal
  * To create captions: home / add / caption; then set length
  * to add additional arrows: add a caption with windings 3 font
  * change project to 4:3 format 
  * export again in high quality
 
 
 
Customized openshot shortcuts:
* ctrl+m: marker
* crtrl+up: center playhead
* J,L = fast forward

## How I synchronize and backup my whole Traktor music and configuration across laptops and a NAS

I have **all** my Traktor files synchronized between laptops. This includes [100Gb of music](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only)
 and all Traktor files.
 
I can use any laptop at any time, one at the time, and my whole collection is there fully analyzed. As my NAS is just another client, I get automatic RAID-0 backups as well.\
In a nutshell this is like having everything inside your own private google drive, without size limits.

My folder structure is:
* C:\Main - Contains all my private files
  * \Traktor - Whole folder synchronized by resilio sync
    * \Samples  - All samples go here
    * \Remix_sets - all remix sets go here
    * \Root_dir  - All settings, stripes, etc go here
      * \Logs
      * \Stripes
      * etc
    * \Music  - all my music goes here. Organization is [by genres](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only)
      * \Genre_1
      * \Genre_2
      * etc
      
Steps were:
* Install [resilio sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/)
* Point your traktor root folder to "C:\Main\Traktor\Root_dir" (Settings / File / Directories / Root_dir)
* Restart traktor
* Do the same for samples and remix sets  (Settings / File / Directories / Samples | Remixe_sets)
* Move your files to "C:\Main\Traktor\Music"
* Share the whole "C:\Main\Traktor" folder in resilio sync

**Warning:** do a manual backup first before changing your traktor files and music collection!

## How to fix DDJ-1000 loose jogs

this reserach was done by Jason Louis in the DDJ-1000 Users Facebook group.

LOOSE JOG WHEEL DISCOVERY 
READ BELOW....

It seems the part that is responsible for keeping the jog wheel in place is not the rollers at all. 

It’s a bracket that has two stationary barrels attached to it. The one in the back is for right to left movement and the one in the front is for front to back movement. 

If you have a jog wheel that is loose this is the part that has failed or has come defective from manufacturing. 

These barrels sit inside of a channel on the under side of the jog wheel top plate ( where your hand makes contact to scratch )

The way the barrels are held onto the bracket is they are pressed into the bracket and center-punched to mushroom the metal to lock it in place on the bottom. 

* When a jog wheel develops front to back movement the front barrel will be found to be loose and exhibit a wobble on the bracket. 

* When a jog wheel develops side to side movement the rear barrel will be found to be loose and exhibit a wobble on the bracket. 

If you are able to carefully center punch the shaft from the bottom of the bracket it is possible to re-secure the barrel.
Once the barrel is secured properly to the bracket your movement in your jog wheel will be eliminated. 

I’m trying to get a part number(s) in case anyone is tired of sending in their unit and it coming back not fixed. 

Honestly this is something that pioneer should have done a recall on as I’ve seen so many posts about it here and on forums and have spoke to SAM ASH and Guitar Center with both retailers aware and complaining about the issue. 

Pioneers stance is to keep quiet when all they had to do is replace this bracket that probably cost them 5.00 to have made. 

The labor for the repair is most likely why they are keeping quiet. It’s just unacceptable.

---------

This is the part that is causing all the problems.
I think it’s expensive for what it is but at least we have all the information we need.
Please share this entire post if this can help someone.

-------

Once you remove the back cover you will see many ribbon cables going to a main PCB. Once you remove all of those cables you will start to unscrew the Main PCB and lift out. After that you will need to take out the track load PCB the pad assy pcb and the loop pcb. once you remove those you can access the jog wheel screws. Note you will have to remove the track select knob , the tension adjust knob and the pitch slider cap to remove above boards before getting to the jog assy. unscrew 5 or 6 screw and remove jog assy and then you will see 2 tabs that can be pulled back gently and the jog wheel lifts up and off the unit. that's the easy part. keeping all the screws in order and where they go is something you should draw out somewhere or take pictures for the first time. ALSO make sure all the plastic buttons are seated properly when you put all the PCBs back so you don't have to reopen the device after you fully assemble it. Hope that helps

Understand how to remove the different ribbons cables, also there's a few wires that need to be placed back a certain way, if you keep good notes and have opened and worked around electronics before you can probably do it, but as I stated before... Unless you know what your doing and have some experience in working on electronics or computers I would have someone else do it.


----

it’s not easy and I would only recommend you attempt if your good with working on electronics.
You have to disassemble a lot of the controller just to get the jog wheel out.
Lots of ribbon cables and removing main and Aux PCB boards

## How to replace the DDJ-1000 filter knobs with Silver knobs

Both 1000 and 1000SRT have extremely [dull filter knobs](../pic_sets/silver_knobs/DDJ-1000RB.jpg). Which is a pity.\
For now the best fit is [DAA1309](https://www.pacparts.com/part.cfm?part_no=DAA1309&mfg=Pioneer) from the DDJ-SZ or DJM-900. This is an almost perfect fit.

Folder with pictures of the knobs: [here](../pic_sets/silver_knobs)

* [DAA1309](../pic_sets/silver_knobs/DAA1309.png):

## 21st century software issues

The 21th century has very clear trends where software cost go down every year.
The main factor of this is simplification and lower quality / minimum viable product, many times at the user burden. Some examples follow.

**Required Updates:**

To reduce cost, both [backwards and forward compatibility](https://www.rainforestqa.com/blog/2017-05-11-common-pitfalls-of-continuous-delivery-deployment-raciness) 
are dropped. Its far far simpler to the developer to just force the user to upgrade **all** components if just **one** them gets upgraded. 
Instead of checking what actually changed, and if the old/unchanged functions would just work fine with the previous version.\  
Typically the server gets updated first, then the client App needs to follow.

Some years ago changes and all protocols had compatibility in mind, so that the user could continue 
using the previous version as long as possible (except urgent security updates).


**Poor Documentation:**

Today apps are far far simpler to use for the **simple tasks**. That is great.

However, the **complex tasks** are being dumbed down by force, and worse, they are no longer documented structurally anymore.

The existing documentation all moved online and is searchable. That is reasonable, but typically there is no longer structured manuals that would explain the features of eg your new mobile phone, 
and every single configuration option.

Other examples are the dumbing down of laptops to approach tablets by force (Windows 8 comes to mind). A Tablet is great for content **consuming**, but a laptop is irreplaceable for content **producing**.\  
Specific examples are Function and insert keys being secondary, the loss of physical buttons like ESC in mac, short keyboards without insert/delete section like it was present on the [standard 102 keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard)


**Subscriptions / Ownership:**

Every year there is fewer laptop users. The "buy once, use forever" model is no longer profitable to small and medium businesses that make unique software. 
The only solution was to ask money for [newer major versions](https://djtechtools.com/2018/10/18/traktor-pro-3-out-now-heres-whats-new/) of the software. Every year this gets more and more difficult.

The alternative is subscriptions that stop working if you stop paying.
Another worrying trend is companies lawyers that removed the notion of ownership, giving you an 
[authorization instead](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/). 

Yet another worrying trend is hardware features that are [unlocked by software](https://electrek.co/2016/11/08/tesla-in-car-purchase-software-locked-features/). 
Back in the days, the price segmentation was clearly made because of hardware limitations: it was physically impossible to send more data / driver faster / etc.
Today, the hardware has gained massive leaps in specifications, but then they come lobotomized by default, and sold as a software upgrade.

## Some people from which I've learned a lot from the Global DJ community

"AKA my DJ hall of fame".
![Hall Of Fame](pics/hall_of_fame.jpg)

When I started DJing in 2000 I've learned a lot from local DJs in Lisbon that I've meet regularly.\
The ones I worked the most were Rui Remix, Bruno Espadinha, Joao Vaz, Jaylion, Miguel Assumpcao and DJ Ice.

20 years later the Internet changed this locality a lot.

You can now learn anything from youtube tutorials, reading articles and have insightful conversations with people that you may never meet.

Below some of the people that I've learned the most. Apologies if I forget anyone.\
All of them made significant contributions either in articles, software or video tutorials. 
In the vast majority this is applicable to any DJ software.

Most of them I've either meet them in person, or I had numerous conversations with them over chat.
