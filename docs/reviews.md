sweet. I love both very big (DDJ-SZ) and very small (think akai AMX) controllers
plus:
 - FX paddles are finally coming more and more in controllers
 - loop encoder, traktor style 
 
ok:
 - no dedicated pad mode  
 - cool jogs
 - symmtric style is appropriate for this small size
 
con:
 - no gain per deck is really bizzare. not even using a shift button it seems
