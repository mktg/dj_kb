## DJ Hall of Fame

![Hall Of Fame](pics/hall_of_fame.jpg)

This is a list of people from which I've learned a lot from the Global DJ community.

When I started DJing in 2000 I've learned a lot from local DJs in Lisbon that I've meet regularly.\
The ones I worked the most were Rui Remix, Bruno Espadinha, Joao Vaz, Jaylion, Miguel Assumpcao and DJ Ice.

20 years later the Internet changed this locality a lot.

You can now learn anything from youtube tutorials, reading articles and have insightful conversations with people that you may never meet.

Below some of the people that I've learned the most. Apologies if I forget anyone.\
All of them made significant contributions either in articles, software or video tutorials. 
In the vast majority this is applicable to any DJ software.

Most of them I've either meet them in person, or I had numerous conversations with them over chat.

## Honorable mentions

These individuals also made contributions that benefit a lot of users.\
Biggest difference to the group above is that I had much less interactions with them.
