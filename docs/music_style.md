## What are Retro, Metal and Reggae remixes

### Retro Remixes
I'm a big fan of Retro remixes ([wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80%27s_remix)). 
These are remixes of modern tracks with typical 80s sounds, but with the original vocal.\  

Good artists to check are

and [Sagkra]( https://www.youtube.com/user/sakgramixesII/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid) have 
only a few retro remixes, but there they are **rely really good**.\

### Metal Remixes


Similar is Metal remixes. In that style, people transform modern tracks in to Hard Rock/Metal style.
There it ranges from playing the guitars/drums on top of the track, all the way to remaking the whole track.\
Good authors to check are [Sindre Myskja](https://www.youtube.com/user/sindremyskja/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid) (this is the best one by far),
[Danny Killian](https://www.youtube.com/user/danyTWIG/videos)) (note: a lot of videos were deleted), 
[Bliix]( https://www.youtube.com/user/bliix/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid)

### Reggae Remixes

Same idea is reggae remixes.
Again, modern tracks are remixed with the typical reggae sounds, but with the original vocal.\

## Examples of Retro, Metal and Reggae remixes
