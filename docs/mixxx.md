## What makes MIXXX unique 

[MIXXX](https://mixxx.org/) is a professional-level DJ software that is fully open-source software.

This means that ANYONE has the complete freedom to improve MIXXX by fixing bugs, extending features or adding entirely new functionality.

Such is unique among any solution, and is severely lacking in all other DJ software that have bugs unfixed for years ([example](#Traktor-Slow-preferences-Window)), possibly forever.

Also interesting, MIXXX is provided at no cost to the users. Anyone can just download, and have a go at it.


## How complete is MIXXX?

Out of the box, MIXXX has a very impressive number of advanced DJ features:
* DVS control to any soundcard
* BPM, Key detection and Sync 
* A very complete list of effects
* DJ controller support, both built-in and contributed, and a mapping wizard for new controllers.

It has [dozens more DJ standard features](https://mixxx.org/features) as well like Loops, Sampler, HotCues, Quantize, Censor, EQ, etc.

I've made a review of MIXXX 2.3 from the point of view of a heavy Traktor user:

## DDJ support in MIXXX
    
MIXXX has good support for the simplest DDJ controllers like 400, RB and SB2 ([full list](https://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/pioneer_ddj_controllers)).
On the 4 Deck controllers it supports the SX, which is compatible to the other S-based controllers like the SX2 and SZ.

For the [DDJ-1000](https://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/ddj-1000) there is a first mapping with the [jog screens](https://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=13346).

I intend to contribute to MIXXX my own DDJ-1000/SX2/SZ mappings soon, based on my [Traktor mappings experiences](#Free-Mappings).

## MIXXX compilation on windows

These links explain how to compile mixxx in windows:

* https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/Build%20Windows%20installer
* https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/visual_studio_community

Potentially, compiling in the WSL could have simpler dependencies:
