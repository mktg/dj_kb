## TL;DR version

My biggest **Laptop** reasons are not having to manage USB sticks, and it has much more features than standalone.\
My biggest **DDJ-1000** reason is big jogwheels.\
My biggest **Traktor** reason is using my OS folders as "playlists", its effects and its advanced mapping possibilities.
