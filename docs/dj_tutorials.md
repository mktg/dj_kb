## How to run a party uisnga a 12V portable battery

Do not use your car battery. 

Instead use deep-cycle batteries, solve for RVs, or marine batteries used by boats. 

These are meant to be used on boats or in RVs, where you’re expected to run appliances off the batteries without the engine running.

(more to add)

## The great Sync debate 

### Audience point of view

About the "dj sync debate", I believe the following: 
a) all preparation that happens while the fader is **DOWN** is not relevant to the audience (see exception below)
b) everything that happens while the fader is **UP** is extremely relevant to the audience

The biggest exception to the above is that beatmatching takes a lot of time of the DJ. It is hard work. 
This time comes on top of track-searching and cueing tasks.

For some audiences like live-streaming, specialized non-commercial music styles, vinyl-only nights, etc they definitely appreciate the DJ to **look** and to **actually be** very busy.\  
To other audiences, this is not relevant at all.

Taking the above rule into account, I then believe the following:

* Beatmatching tracks that beatgrid well is just a waste of time
* Using sync on tracks that **do not** beatgrid well is very damaging
    * this is why elastic beatgrids are so important
* Some tricks typically associated with vinyl/beatmatching are definitely enjoyed by the audience, eg TT break / TT stop
* Beatmatching forces you to hear and known the tracks much better. It is a significant help in respecting and leveraging the phrasing structure of the tracks.


### DJ point of view

Typically the DJ has a different point of view than that of the audience. 

Beatmatching can range from being very enjoyable to being a burden. It definitely is a huge barrier to beginners that pursue this path.\  
DJs themselves tend to enjoy being busy, so beatmatching is one way to satisfy that need.\  
This also happens a lot with other topics like excessive use of EQ tuning, Effects, Scratching, sampling, etc.

In the end I recommend that you learn Beatmatching as a useful backup tool for the cases of 80s, live drummers, unanalysed tracks, older equipment, vinyl, acapellas, etc.

## Recommendation to DJTT DJ course

<https://store.djtechtools.com/products/dj-techtools-live-master-classes#course1>

I've been very lucky to be in the first 2x interactive DJ course by Ean Golden. The level ranges from Intermediate to Advanced, with an emphasis in advanced, which I really enjoyed.

An absolute bargain for the price, you get 6x completely interactive sessions where Ean explains extremly useful and real-world proven DJ techniques, covering the entire DJing spectrum.  
There you see Ean's real collection, tracks, cues and loops, where he shows over and over the techniques that he wrote in DJTT blog posts since 2007.  
<https://djtechtools.com/2015/05/17/the-history-of-dj-techtools/>

Even better, you can ask any question at any time. But crucially, the questions are moderated by RandomFPV (Chris Benoit), 
to ask them in the best order and at the best possible time. This SIGNIFICANTLY improves this process to be a lot more efficient and clear.

The cherry on top of the cake is an after-party zoom call where you discuss and interact these and other
 topics with your peers - the other students - from all over the world.

AFAIK this course and format is unique. It specifically targets intermediate and advanced levels. While very high-quality as well, 
AFAIK other courses are only prerecorded and are typically start at beginners and up.  
Nothing wrong with that, but I personally prefer this model and target audience a lot more.

Looking forward more follow-up courses, namely by other high-quality Tutors, in the same efficient format.
