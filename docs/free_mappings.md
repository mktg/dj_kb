## How to DOWNLOAD my Traktor mappings:

TO DOWNLOAD: you can ONLY download my mappings from the DJ tech tools site (http://maps.djtechtools.com).\
To do this you MUST register and then verify your email there.

Note: sometimes that site is under maintenance. Please try later in this case.

## How to INSTALL my Traktor mappings:

TO INSTALL: Please see this video where I show how to install the mappings: https://youtu.be/MbGP_ECnWiQ\
See also this PDF file for step-by-step instructions: [installation guide](https://github.com/pestrela/dj_maps/blob/master/mapping_ddj_1000/3%20Documentation)\
See also the common questions: [FAQ](https://github.com/pestrela/dj_maps/blob/master/mapping_ddj_1000/3%20Documentation)

Some notes:

* **#1:** My guides covers all DDJ controllers. The only difference is the Aliases (page 10) and Output (page 28). The Annexes have specific pictures for specific DDJs.
* **#2:** This mapping requires the third-party BOME midi translator. It has a free trial for you to test this mapping before buying a license.
* **#3:** Issues? See the FAQ in a pdf, the “gotchas” on page 34, and reconfirm if you missed a step of this guide.

## Which are your Keyboard mappings?

### A) Beatgrid helper

**Links:**

*	Download Link: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9760

**Summary:**

*	Use this mapping to beatgrid your music in Traktor faster
*	Features: quick seek,  quick zoom, next song, shortcut, lock, auto, etc
*	All keys have a “faster” version using the shift

![](pics/beatgrid_helper_-_slide.jpg?raw=true)


### B) Transitions-Aligned Beatjumps

**Links:**

*	https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9762

**Summary:**

*	Use this mapping to prepare transitions-aligned beatjumps. This mapping lets you beatjump on both deck A and B simultaneously, so that you can put CUEs to align them
*	Row “one” of your keyboard beatjumps deck A; row “two” beatjumps deck B; row “three” beatjumps both decks simultaneously. Row “zero” controls the crossfader as well. 
*	EXAMPLE: please the transition around 52m of this mix.Song “A” is singing when “B” starts entering at 52m07s. For 30s, song “A” is singing normally. When “A” stops singing at 52m41s, “B” starts singing exactly at that time. This mapping helps a lot these fun transitions.

## What documentation comes with your mappings?

My zip files have **a lot** of documentation besides the TSI file.\
IMO it has no comparison to the typical mappings available on https://maps.djtechtools.com/ or https://www.traktorbible.com/freaks 

Included is:

* Quick reference (pictures only): [example](mapping_ddj_1000/DDJ-1000%20-%20Quick%20overview.pdf)
* User manual: [example](mapping_ddj_1000/DDJ-1000%20-%20Detailed%20manual.pdf)

* FAQ: [example](mapping_ddj_1000/Installation%20Help/DDJ%20Mappings%20-%20Frequently%20Asked%20Questions.pdf)

Plus:

* Technical info (to extend the mapping): [traktor_side](mapping_ddj_1000/Support%20files/Technical%20Info%20-%20Traktor%20side.txt) [bome_side](mapping_ddj_1000/Support%20files/Technical%20Info%20-%20BOME%20side.txt)
* Every single function: [example](mapping_ddj_1000/Support%20files/Source%20files/DDJ%20-%20Detailed%20reference.xlsx)

## Can I see a Demo video of your mappings?

Yes, please see the below Youtube videos. I have both long 30m videos where I cover every single function step-by-step, plus short "update" 5m video with the latest stuff only.

All videos are timestamp-tagged in Minute:second format, for you to find explanations of all specific.

## Can I test your mappings for FREE?

Yes. All my mappings work fine with the demo versions of both Traktor and BOME. So if you have these controllers you can just try them in no time. 

If you are considering buying equipment then I recommend that you test the mapping yourself in a shop showroom. I do this all the time before I buy anything (just mention this to the shop personnel).

Finally, all my mappings are a free gift to the community, to enable DJs to use their preferred Software with their preferred Hardware.

## What are the differences between MIDI mode and HID mode?

The DDJ-1000 can run in two different modes: MIDI or HID. 
The most obvious difference is the only HID has waveforms on the jog screens.

However there are many other smaller differences, summarized [here](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/ddj-1000#differences-between-midi-mode-and-hid-mode).

[original source](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/ddj-1000#differences-between-midi-mode-and-hid-mode)

## Missing jog screens on DDJ-800 and DDJ-1000SRT

Both the DDJ-800 and the DDJ-1000SRT do not have jog screens in MIDI mode. 

The reasons are:

* DDJ-800: 
  * this is due to a bug. The documentation describes the screens, but they are just broken.
  * to report this **yourself**, click [here](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72145/) and mention ticket "#147606"
* DDJ-1000SRT:
  * this is **not** a bug. It is a business decision of the Serato company.
  * to request this **yourself**, click [here](https://serato.com/forum/discussion/1736390/)

## Can I use your mapping with the DDJ-1000SRT?

YES. In the [free zip file](https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9222) 
I have a **dedicated** DDJ-1000SRT version, featuring minor adaptations.

Video demo: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU3QnOez56A)

**Important:** the screens are NOT supported because of a bussiness decision of the Serato company.
Please ask Serato directly for this: <https://serato.com/forum/discussion/1736390>

## Can I use your mapping with the DDJ-XP2?

The XP2 is now really popular because its the cheapest way 
to unlock [Rekordbox V6 performance](#What-is-NOT-unlocked-in-the-Rekordbox-V6-hardware-options).
 
My [DDJ-1000 mapping](https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9279) is compatible with the XP1/XP2.\
So it will work. But it was not made specific to it, so some features might be missing.

Strong recommendation is to use v6.3.3 of my DDJ-1000 mapping.\
This is because later versions require [BOME](https://www.bome.com/products/miditranslator), 
are more complex [to install](mapping_ddj_1000/Installation%20Help/DDJ%20Mappings%20-%20Installation%20Guide.pdf), 
and focus on non-XP2-relevant features like the jog screens.
  
  
## Can I use your mapping with the DDJ-800?

YES. In the [free zip file](https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9279) 
I have a **dedicated** DDJ-800 version, featuring minor adaptations.

Video Demo: [here](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLUQkm-2KX0&list=PLIlvTGzSxI0XHlFyINdT6P42noqvkPISD&index=9)

**Important:** The screens are NOT supported because of a **Pioneer bug.**\  
Please ask Pioneer directly for this: [instructions](#Missing-jog-screens-on-DDJ-800-and-DDJ-1000SRT)


## Can I use your mapping with the DDJ-SX2, SX3, RX, etc?

YES. All these controllers are compatible.\  
Download the [free zip file](https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9222) and choose the main SZ/SX2 mapping.



  
  
## Does (random DDJ controller) works with your mapping? Are the jogs good?

Pioneer has **dozens** of controllers. 
I own 3x of them, so ONLY there the mappings are 100% tight:

* DDJ-1000
* DDJ-SZ
* DDJ-SX2

The other controllers [are compatible](https://github.com/pestrela/ddj/tree/main/1%20MIDI%20codes) - but there are always differences.\
**So for these [please try the mapping FOR FREE](#can-i-test-your-mappings-for-free) in a shop/friend.**

Once in a while I test controllers in a shop myself; ONLY in this case I describe the results in the first page of the mapping manual.\
The DDJ-1000SRT is a special case, [which I cover in detail here](#is-the-ddj-1000srt-also-mappable-to-traktor)


Regarding the Jogs: this is exactly the same story, plus the [all the comments about MIDI jogs](#But-can-i-still-scratch-using-MIDI-How-much-is-the-latency-of-your-maps)

## Read this if your Play button doesnt work

Are you using a custom mapping? Does some functions work but not the Play/Pause button?

This is a typical sign of a double installed mapping. Play works as a "toggle", so if its applied twice it cancels itself.

Solution:

* Delete all mapping pages in the controller manager
* install the desired mapping only once
