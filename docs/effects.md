## Description of the basic effects 

These are definitions from the basic effects. This will be useful later to describe the FX chains (combos).

* Basic FX:
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal_processing#Audio_effects
    * Delay = repeat sound once after X beats (can be fractional)
    * Echo = repeat sound multiple times, with decreasing intensity
    * Reverb = repeat sound multiple times heavily very soon
    * Flanger = a single delay with very short duration (short phase)
    * Filter = lower/cut or raise specific frequencies
    * Overdrive = clipping to increase loudness
    * Pitch = changing tone with same tempo
    * Resonators = emphasize harmonic frequency content on specified frequencies.
    * Modulation = change frequency in relation to a signal
    * Compression = reduction of dynamic range
    * Gate = ON/OFF synced to BPM
  
## How to create unique effects by chaining base effects 

You can easily create unique effects by chaining existing effects in very specific ways.

This is called the "Fader FX theory" as invented by Ean Golden in 2008:

* **Article:** https://djtechtools.com/2008/12/15/fader-fx-theory/
* **Demo video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjjA0xPkXMs
  
This uses 3x effects in a chain:

* **Slot 1:** Repeating effect 
    * eg: Beatmasher, Gater, Delays
* **Slot 2:** Shaping effect 
    * eg: Filter, Lo-fi, Peak filter
* **Slot 3:** Dimensional effect 
    * eg: Reverb, delay
  
Below, blog posts on a) lists of FX chains and b) descriptions of MixerFX / MacroFX / SoundColorFX.


## List of FX Chains 

This is the original article where Ean Golden applied these FX chains to the jogwheels (JogFX):

## Which basic effects constitute Traktor mixerFX and macroFX?
  
MixerFX / MacroFX are essentially FX chains with specific defaults and behavior.\
This post describes the basic elements of MixerFX using simpler base effects (delay, echo, filter, reverb, flanger, beatmasher, bitcrush, white noise).


### TP3.0 MIXERFX

* https://djtechtools.com/2018/10/18/traktor-pro-3-out-now-heres-whats-new/
* Reverb: resonant reverb + heavy filter
* Dual Delay: 1/2 delay + filter
* Dotted Delay: heavy delay (staccato)
* Noise: white noise + filter
* Time Gater: ON/OFF BPM-sync + filter
* Flanger: 4-beat flanger + filter
* Barber Pole: soft Shepard Tone
* Crush: bit crush (no pitch increase) + filter
* Filter: Filter + Light resonance

### TP2.6 MACROFX

* https://techtools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202165534-NEW-MACRO-FX
* https://crossfadr.com/2012/11/21/overhauling-the-traktor-native-instruments-new-traktor-pro-2-6-release/
* Wormhole = heavy filter + heavy flanger + delay (Buildup//breakdown)
* PolarWind = heavy flanger (coloring) + light filter + reverb (Mixing/punch in)
* FlightTest = heavy echo + resonant filter (Punch In)
* LaserSlicer = heavy beatmasher + flanger (Punch in/buildup/breakdown)
* DarkMatter = heavy crush + delay + compression (for Mixing)
* Zzzurp = related to Ringmodulator (masher + flanger + crush + reverb) (Punch in/breakdown)
* EventHorizon = heavy filter + echo (Breakdown/punch in)
* Bass-o-Matic = heavy triplets slicer (Punch in/breakdown)
* Strrretch (Slow) = loop sampler (Buildup/breakdown)
* Strrretch (Fast) = loop sampler (Buildup/breakdown)
* GranuPhase = delay to 2nd and 4th beat (Punch in/buildup/breakdown)

### TP2.0 effects

* https://www.digitaldjtips.com/reviews/native-instruments-traktor-kontrol-z2/
* Transpose Stretch = Dubstep-style
* Ringmodulator = Josh Wink “tweak”
* Tape Delay = “chillwave”

To test these effects, loop a simple beat and characterize what you hear based on basic FX concepts.  
To test delay/echo/reverb presence, stop the track to hear the FX tail.

### RMX-1000
* https://djtechtools.com/2016/08/02/rekordbox-4-2-1-rmx-effects-vinyl-recording/
* https://djtechtools.com/2012/05/06/pioneer-rmx-1000-effects-unit-review/
* BPF Echo – Adds the sound that has passed through the band pass filter to the original sound and adds echo.
* Noise – Adds white noise generated internally to the sound.
* Spiral Up – Raises pitch of the sound while changing echo reverberation time.
* Reverb Up – Adds a reverberation effect to the sound and raises the pitch of the echo as time passes.

### RMX-1000 - Effects for inserting breaks into tracks

* HPF Echo – Passes the sound through the high pass filter and adds echo.
* LPF Echo – Passes the sound through the low pass filter and adds echo.
* Crush Echo – Creates a sound as if the sound were crushed and adds echo.
* Spiral Down – Lowers the pitch of the sound while changing echo reverberation time.
* Reverb Down – Adds a reverberation effect to the sound and lowers the pitch of the echo as time passes.”
