## How to learn good transition points by reconstructing sets

One great way to learn good mixing points is to recreate existing mixes made by others, for learning purposes.

In 1995 I've heard my favorite mixed CD ever: "Kaos Totally Mix 1, mixed live by Dj Vibe at Kremlin, Lisbon, Portugal."
In the last 25 years, I listened to this CD at least 75 times, probably a lot more.

But only by recreating the mix first in Adobe Audition and then in Traktor I found (all?) the technical tricks of the amazing work by Dj Vibe. Amazing work!!

Versions:
* This is the original mix in youtube, uploaded by Kaos Records Portugal
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuun-IcRuTw
* This is a pack with all the individual tracks with their traktor cues. 
  * Please match as follows: 1<->5 / 2<->6 / 3<->7 / 4<->8; 
  * some cues are gradual IN/OUT fades, some are already open faders.
